# About Mebin Thattil

Hey, I'm Mebin 👋🏻! I'm a first year student at PES University, Bangalore, India, currently pursuing a BTech in Computer Science. I’ve had a deep passion for tech ever since I was 10, when I first learned in a CS class that you could write a couple of lines of code and build a (barely functional) website. That simple idea sparked something in me, and over the years, my love for computer science has only grown—especially while building a bunch of cool things along the way.

I'm going to spend my summer working on the [Speak Activity](https://github.com/sugarlabs/speak). I will be refactoring the chatbot in the speak activity to use Gen-AI.

About a month ago, I launched my personal portfolio website: [mebin.in](https://mebin.in/). It runs on an 8-year-old Raspberry Pi sitting at home 🤩, so apologies in advance if the site is occasionally slow or down (power cuts are a real pain). I ocassionally write blogs there.

I'm also building a Bluesky client in the Nim programming language. I'm a strong advocate for education in technology. In the past, I built a web application aimed at connecting students in rural areas with those in urban areas to help foster a free and open peer-to-peer learning ecosystem.

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

Cambridge, Mass., May 15, 2008 — Sugar Labs Foundation is being established to further extend Sugar, the highly acclaimed open-source “learn learning” software platform originally developed for the One Laptop per Child (OLPC) XO laptop. Sugar is the core of the XO laptop’s human-computer interface; it provides a fun, easy-to-use, social experience that promotes sharing and learning.

Sugar Labs will focus on providing a software ecosystem that enhances learning on the XO laptop as well as other laptops distributed by companies such as the ASUS Eee PC. Consistent with OLPC’s mission to provide opportunities for learning, an independent Sugar Labs Foundation can deliver learning software to other hardware vendors and, consequently, reach more children.

Sugar Labs will take a proven learning concept to the next level of refinement, stability, and cohesiveness, and will be a unifying catalyst for free and open-source learning systems across multiple distribution and hardware platforms. The Labs will support a community of developers focused on learning, as well as support for the learners themselves. The Sugar platform has already been bundled with the most recent releases of the Ubuntu and Fedora GNU/Linux distributions.

Walter Bender, former president of software and content at OLPC, is helping launch Sugar Labs, working closely with developers and community members from around the world who have played lead roles in developing the Sugar user interface (UI). Prior to OLPC, Bender was executive director and a founding member of the Media Lab at MIT. He has participated in much pioneering research in electronic publishing and personalized, interactive multimedia.

In order to provide a rich learning experience to as many of the world’s children as possible, it is critical not just to provide computers to children, but also to ensure that the software maximizes their potential for engaging in learning activities: exploration, expression, and collaboration. By being independent of any specific hardware platform and by remaining dedicated to the principles of free and open-source software, Sugar Labs ensures that others can develop diverse interfaces and applications from which governments and schools can choose. An independent Sugar Labs ensures that the community can continue the development of a highly innovative interface that is already engaging children in learning in more than two dozen countries worldwide.

“This is a very exciting time in the development of software for children’s education,” said Walter Bender. “In the first generation of the Sugar UI, the free and open-source community has demonstrated an exceptional ability to create a platform that enables children to explore the world, share their discoveries, and express themselves. As a separate foundation, we will be able to advance Sugar’s development even further and make it available on multiple distributions and hardware platforms.”

Many of the core Sugar developers are participating in the launch, including Marco Pesenti Gritti, Bert Freudenberg, Simon Schampijer, Bernardo Innocenti, Aaron Kaplan, Christoph Derndorfer, and Tomeu Vizoso.

Bert Freudenberg, one of the developers of the Etoys activity, commented, “Expanding Sugar to more hardware platforms gives a great boost to all developers of educational software. Sugar is the first system specifically aimed at helping children to learn while supporting a rich variety of contributed applications. As third-party developers, my colleagues at Viewpoints Research Institute look forward to a great relationship with Sugar Labs.”

Tomeu Vizoso added, “Sugar has been brought to maturity by OLPC and a relatively small team of community supporters. The time has come to unlock Sugar’s potential as a global education project; the creation of Sugar Labs is the next step — expanding upon a project where people from all around the world can contribute to improving education, with the assurance that their efforts will be of benefit to everyone.”

The Sugar community now has an active global developer base that is focused on engaging young children in learning through computing and the Internet. As a member of the Conservancy, the Sugar community will work to accelerate the adoption of the Sugar learning platform and strengthen the project by attracting new industry members and community contributors.

In May 2008, the Sugar project became independent of OLPC, making Sugar available to a wider community of developers and users. Subsequently, Sugar has been ported to Debian, Ubuntu, and other GNU/Linux distributions. Sugar can now run on almost any computer hardware. In October 2008, Sugar Labs released Sugar Version 0.82, which features enhanced usability and stability. In November, Sugar announced the availability of the pre-alpha version of “Sugar on a Stick,” a LiveUSB image of Sugar that gives children access to Sugar on any computer using just a USB key. Joining the Conservancy is an important milestone in the path toward making Sugar available to children everywhere.

Founded in March 2006, the Conservancy allows developers of its member projects to unite under a common organization that provides much-needed administrative services. This structure spares each software project the burden of starting and maintaining its own independent non-profit organization. Sugar Labs has joined as the Conservancy’s fifteenth member project.

Cambridge, MA, March 16, 2009: Sugar Labs™ anuncia que la versión 0.84 de la Plataforma de Aprendizaje de Sugar para la XO-1 de OLPC, las PCs de aula y los notebooks ya se encuentra disponible. Diseñada desde un principio para los niños, el entorno Sugar es usado aproximadamente por un millón de estudiantes, cuyas edades fluctúan entre los 5 y 12 años, en aproximadamente 40 países durante todos los días del calendario escolar. Esta versión mejorada se caracteriza por poseer nuevas Actividades colaborativas. Asimismo, y en respuesta a la retroalimentación brindada por los docentes, posee la capacidad para detener y reanudar las Actividades con facilidad, lo cual permite ahorrar tiempo en el aula.

Walter Bender, Director Ejecutivo de Sugar Labs, comentó lo siguiente: “Nos encontramos muy emocionados con este lanzamiento que funciona en un mayor número de PCs que antes y posee Actividades nuevas y únicas para que los niños investiguen juntos, tales como la Actividad Mapa Mental, una herramienta de pensamiento crítico que se usa para crear diagramas que representan conceptos e ideas que se encuentran relacionados y dispuestos alrededor de una palabra clave o de una idea central y la Actividad Portafolio, una herramienta de evaluación que brinda mayor facilitad para que tanto los docentes como los padres de familia revisen el progreso que realiza el niño.” 

Igualmente, el Diario Sugar, que proporciona un back up automático y el historial del trabajo de los estudiantes, posee nuevas características a fin de permitirles tomar apuntes o hacer comentarios respecto a su trabajo, así como volver a visitar y revisar proyectos anteriores. Por su parte, la nueva Actividad Infoslicer (Selecciona y Corta Información) permite a los docentes seleccionar el contenido de páginas Web con facilidad y rapidez para editarlo, organizarlo y distribuirlo como material pedagógico. De igual modo, para los estudiantes mayores que tienen curiosidad por saber cómo funcionan las computadoras, la función Vista de Código es actualmente general para todas las Actividades.

La Plataforma de Aprendizaje Sugar es un software libre y de código abierto y se encuentra disponible para ser descargado en www.sugarlabs.org. Sugar, la interfaz originaria de la XO-1 de OLPC de uso diario en todo el mundo, ha sido traducida a 26 idiomas y tiene 50 idiomas más en proceso de traducción. El apoyo comunitario se encuentra disponible en línea las 24 horas al día/7 días a la semana. Sugar se encuentra disponible en las principales distribuciones GNU/Linux, las últimas computadoras con virtualización Apple Macintosh™ y las PCs Windows™ ejecutadas vía un Live CD de GNU/Linux que no modifica el disco duro. Igualmente, en el tercer trimestre del 2009, se ha programado el lanzamiento de Sugar en formato de tarjeta de memoria (memoria flash) extraíble, una versión de Live USB diseñada para simplificar el uso de Sugar en el aula.

La plataforma de aprendizaje de Sugar forma parte de la colección permanente del Museo de Arte Moderno de Nueva York. Asimismo, en los International Design Excellence Awards ’08 (Premios Internacionales a la Excelencia en Diseño 2008) le fue otorgada una medalla de plata. Su innovador enfoque “centrado en el aprendizaje” ha recibido elogios por parte de los docentes a nivel mundial. Las Actividades de Sugar, exclusivas de la plataforma, permiten a los alumnos estudiar y crear juntos. Los estudiantes aprenden tanto del docente como de otros alumnos.

El Sr. Bender comentó lo siguiente: “Sugar 0.84 representa un paso importante a medida que se trabaja para lograr la versión 1.0 de Sugar en formato de tarjeta de memoria extraíble que simplificará, en gran medida, la evaluación y el uso de Sugar en el aula. Asimismo, este formato de tarjeta de memoria extraíble hace posible que Sugar se ejecute a partir de un simple formato de memoria USB en casi cualquier computadora actual desde las notebooks (computadora portátil) hasta las desktops (computadora personal), así como en la mayoría de PCs más antiguas, sin interferir con las instalaciones de software preexistente.”

“A medida que nos aproximamos al millón de niños “aprendiendo a aprender” con Sugar en la XO-1 de OLPC, solicitamos voluntarios que se unan a nosotros — un reto para los programadores, diseñadores, traductores e implementadores”, refirió el Sr. Bender. “Necesitamos especialmente probadores de software que nos ayuden a hacer de Sugar en formato de tarjeta de memoria extraíble una sólida solución que se encuentre disponible dondequiera que exista una computadora.”

Cambridge, MA, le 16 mars 2009: Sugar Labs™ annonce la sortie de la version 0.84 de sa plateforme d’apprentissage Sugar destinée au XO-1 du projet One Laptop Per Child, aux micro-ordinateurs des établissements scolaires, et aux ordinateurs netbook. Conçu pour enfants de A à Z, l’environnement Sugar est utilisé par près d’un million d’élèves de 5 à 12 ans dans plus de 40 pays, tous les jours. Cette nouvelle version contient de nouvelles Activités Sugar à faire à plusieurs en travail collaboratif et, à la demande des professeurs, prévoit la possibilité d’interrompre et de reprendre facilement les Activités, pour gagner du temps en classe.

Walter Bender, Directeur Exécutif de Sugar Labs, a dit: "Cette nouvelle version est compatible avec beaucoup plus de PC qu’auparavant, et contient de nouvelles Activités que les enfants adoreront découvrir ensemble, comme l’Activité Mindmap, un outil qui développe l’esprit critique et permet de créér des diagrammes représentant des mots et des idées à partir d’un mot-clé central, et l’Activité Portfolio, un outil d’évaluation permettant aux professeurs et aux parents d’établir très simplement les progrès réalisés par l’enfant. Le Journal Sugar, qui fournit une sauvegarde automatique et un historique du travail de l’élève, comporte de nouvelles fonctionnalités permettant aux élèves d’annoter plus facilement leurs travaux, et de reprendre ou réviser des projets déjà réalisés. La nouvelle activité Infoslicer permet aux professeurs de sélectionner rapidement et facilement du contenu pris sur internet, de le modifier et de le remettre en forme pour le redistribuer comme documents pédagogiques. Et pour les élèves plus grands qui veulent savoir comment marchent les ordinateurs, la fonction View Source (voir code source) a été généralisée à toutes les Activités.”

La plateforme d’apprentissage Sugar est un logiciel libre. Elle peut être téléchargée sur le site www.sugarlabs.org. Interface d’origine du projet One Laptop Per Child déjà utilisé quotidiennement dans le monde entier, Sugar a déjà été traduite dans 26 langues et 50 autres doivent suivre. Un soutien technique de la communauté est disponible en ligne 24h/24, 7 jours/7. Sugar est disponible sur toutes les grandes distributions GNU/Linux, les ordinateurs Apple Macintosh™ récents avec virtualisation, et pour PC sous Windows™ via un liveCD GNU/Linux, qui ne touche pas au disque dur. Sugar on a Stick, une version liveUSB censée simplifier l’utilisation de Sugar en classe, doit sortir au 3e trimestre 2009.

La plateforme d’apprentissage Sugar fait partie de la collection permanente du Musée d’Art Moderne de New York, et a reçu la médaille d’argent au Palmarès 2008 de l’excellence du design international (International Design Excellence Awards). Son approche innovante, centrée sur l’apprentissage, a été saluée par les enseignants du monde entier. Les Activités Sugar, disponibles exclusivement sur cette plateforme, permettent aux élèves d’étudier et de créér ensemble: les étudiants apprennent du professeur mais aussi les uns des autres.

Selon M. Bender, “Sugar 0.84 est une étape importante vers la version 1.0 de Sugar on a Stick, qui va considérablement simplifier l’évaluation et l’utilisation de Sugar en classe. Avec Sugar on a Stick, on pourra lancer Sugar à partir d’une simple clé USB sur la plupart des ordinateurs récents, des netbooks aux ordinateurs de bureau, et aussi sur la plupart des vieux PC, sans perturber les logiciels déjà installés.”

“Alors que nous nous approchons du millionième enfant “apprenant à apprendre” avec Sugar sur le XO-1 de One Laptop per Child, nous appelons de nouveau bénévoles à venir nous aider à relever ce défi éducatif: développeurs, concepteurs, traducteurs, et déployeurs”, a déclaré M. Bender. “Nous avons notamment besoin de testeurs pour nous aider à faire de Sugar on a Stick une solution robuste qui fonctionnera avec n’importe quel ordinateur.”

Cambridge, MA, March 16, 2009: Sugar Labs™ announces the availability of version 0.84 of the Sugar Learning Platform for the One Laptop Per Child XO-1, classroom PCs, and netbook computers. Designed from the ground up for children, the Sugar computer environment is used by almost one-million students aged 5 to 12 in over 40 countries every school day. This improved version features new collaborative Sugar Activities and, in response to teacher feedback, the ability to easily suspend and resume Activities, saving time in the classroom.

Walter Bender, Executive Director of Sugar Labs, commented: “We’re excited about this release, which runs on more PCs than before and has great new Activities for kids to explore together such as a Mindmap Activity, a critical-thinking tool used to create diagrams representing words and ideas around a central keyword, and a Portfolio Activity, an assessment tool that makes it even simpler for teachers and parents to review a child’s progress. The Sugar Journal, which provides automatic backup and history of students’ work, has new features to make it easier for students to annotate their work and to revisit and revise past projects. The new Infoslicer Activity enables teachers to quickly and easily select web-based content to edit, package, and distribute as teaching materials. And for older students curious about how computers work, the View Source function is now universal to all Activities.”

The Sugar Learning Platform is free open-source software; it is available for download at www.sugarlabs.org. The native interface of the One Laptop Per Child project’s XO-1 in daily use around the globe, Sugar has been translated into 26 languages with 50 more languages underway. 24/7 community support is available online. Sugar is available on major GNU/Linux distributions, recent Apple Macintosh™ computers with virtualization, and Windows™ PCs via a GNU/Linux liveCD, which doesn’t touch the hard disk. Sugar on a Stick, a liveUSB version designed to simplify classroom use of Sugar, is scheduled for release in Q3 2009.

The Sugar Learning Platform is part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York and was awarded a silver medal in the International Design Excellence Awards ’08. Its innovative “learning-centric” approach has earned praise from educators worldwide. Sugar Activities, unique to the platform, allow students to study and create together; students learn both from the teacher and from each other.

Mr. Bender commented, “Sugar 0.84 is an important step as we work toward version 1.0 of Sugar on a Stick, which will greatly simplify evaluation and use of Sugar in the classroom. Sugar on a Stick will start Sugar from a simple USB memory stick on nearly any recent computer from netbooks to desktops, and most older PCs as well, without interfering with pre-existing software installations.”

“As we approach the one-millionth child ‘learning to learn’ with Sugar on the OLPC XO-1, we call for volunteers to join us—a challenge to educate for developers, designers, translators, and deployers,” Mr. Bender said. “In particular, we need testers to help us make Sugar on a Stick a robust solution available anywhere there is a computer.”

Cambridge, MA, 16. März, 2009: Sugar Labs™ hat die Version 0.84 der Lernplattform Sugar freigegeben. Die Software ist auf dem XO-1 von One Laptop Per Child, PCs und Netbooks einsetzbar. Die speziell für Kinder entwickelte Plattform wird von fast einer Million Schülern im Alter von 5 bis 12 Jahren in über 40 Ländern täglich im Schulunterricht eingesetzt.

Walter Bender, Geschäftsführer von Sugar Labs, sagt hierzu: “Wir sind gespannt auf die neue Version, die auf mehr PCs läuft als zuvor und neue, interessante Activities zum gemeinsamen Erkunden beinhaltet. Zum Beispiel die Mindmap Activity, ein Werkzeug zum Erstellen von Diagrammen, die Beziehungen zwischen einem Schlüsselwort und diesem zugeordneten Begriffen aufzeigen. Oder die Portfolio Activity, ein Bewertungswerkzeug, das es Lehrern und Eltern einfacher macht, den Fortschritt eines Kindes zu beurteilen. Das Journal, eine Art Tagebuch, das dem Schüler die chronologische Aufzeichnung seiner Aktivitäten bereitstellt, wurde erweitert. Der Schüler hat es nun leichter seine Arbeiten zu kommentieren und seine Projekte zu überarbeiten. Die neue Infoslicer Activity ermöglicht es Lehrern, schnell und einfach web-basierte Inhalte zu editieren, zusammenzustellen und als Lehrmaterial bereitzustellen. Schüler, die an der Funktionsweise eines Computers interessiert sind, können die View Source Funktion nutzen um tiefere Einblicke zu erhalten. Außerdem wurde in der Entwicklung der Software auf Verbesserungsvorschläge von Lehrern eingegangen. So ist es nun einfacher, vorangegangene Activities fortzuführen, wodurch im Unterricht Zeit eingespart werden kann.

Die Lernplattform Sugar ist Open Source Software und kann von www.sugarlabs.org heruntergeladen werden. Sugar wurde in 26 Sprachen übersetzt und 50 weitere Übersetzungen sind in Bearbeitung. Die Sugar-Gemeinschaft ist Online immer für Fragen und Anregungen offen. Die Plattform ist erhältlich in allen größeren Linux-Distributionen. Sugar kann als Live-System unter Windows™ von einem CD-Image gestartet werden und kann auf Apple Macintosh™ Computern virtualisiert ausgeführt werden. Sugar on a Stick, ein Live-System, das von USB-Speichermedien gestartet wird, und den Einsatz in Computerlaboren erleichtern soll, wird voraussichtlich im dritten Quartal von 2009 erscheinen.

Die Lernplattform Sugar ist Teil der ständigen Ausstellung des Museum of Modern Art in New York. 2008 erhielt sie die Silber-Medaille des International Design Excellence Awards in der Kategorie Interactive Product Experiences. Ihr innovativer lernorientierter Ansatz erhielt weltweites Lob von Pädagogen. Sugar Activities, die einmalig für diese Plattform sind, ermöglichen es den Schülern gemeinsam zu lernen und kreativ zu werden, Schüler können sowohl von ihrem Lehrer als auch voneinander lernen.

Bender fügt hinzu: “Sugar 0.84 ist ein wichtiger Schritt im Hinblick auf die Version 1.0 von Sugar on a Stick, die die Evaluation und die Anwendung von Sugar im Unterricht vereinfachen wird. Sugar on a Stick lädt Sugar von einem USB-Speichermedium auf nahezu jedem gängigen Computer, ob Netbook oder Desktop PC, ohne dabei mit der bereits installierten Software in Konflikt zu geraten.”

“Weil bald das millionste Kind mit Sugar auf dem OLPC XO-1 ‘lernt zu lernen’ laden wir alle Freiwilligen dazu ein, mitzumachen—eine Herausforderung für Entwickler, Pädagogen, Designer, Übersetzer und Anwender,” sagt Bender. “Vor allem brauchen wir Software-Tester, die uns helfen aus Sugar on a Stick eine Alternative zu vorhandener Software auf allen verfügbaren Computern zu machen.”

Cambridge, MA, April 22, 2009: Sugar Labs™ announces the availability for testing of Sugar on a Stick Beta‑1. This version of the free open-source Sugar Learning Platform, available at [www.sugarlabs.org](http://www.sugarlabs.org) for loading on any 1 Gb or greater USB stick, is designed to facilitate exploration of the award-winning Sugar interface beyond its original platform, the One Laptop per Child XO‑1, to such varied hardware as aging PCs and recent Macs to the latest netbooks.

Teachers and parents interested in trying Sugar with children can download the Sugar on a Stick beta‑1 file from the Sugar Labs website and load it onto a USB stick by following the instructions at [wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick).

Walter Bender, Executive Director of Sugar Labs, said: “Sugar is perfectly suited for children in the classroom with its simple, colorful interface, built-in collaboration, and open architecture. Sugar on a Stick lets you start a computer with Sugar and store a child’s data on the stick without touching the host computer’s hard disk. Sugar’s Activities such as Write, a shared word processor, and the recently announced InfoSlicer Activity, which enables teachers to easily collect and package web-based content for the classroom, benefit fully from Sugar’s collaboration features.”

Caroline Meeks of Solution Grove ([www.solutiongrove.com](http://www.solutiongrove.com)), the Sugar on a Stick project manager, commented: “We’re counting on teachers to help us improve Sugar on a Stick as we work towards our Version‑1 release scheduled for Q3 2009. We just presented Sugar on a Stick at the FOSS VT conference (<http://www.ncose.org/node/47>) where it generated great interest, and our real-world tests at local sites with varied aging PCs have been very encouraging.”

Sugar testers are invited to send bug information and constructive criticism to [feedback@sugarlabs.org](mailto:feedback@sugarlabs.org). “We won’t be able to reply to every message,” continued Ms. Meeks, “but we will read every one in order to make Sugar on a Stick a reliable learning tool in budget-stretched classrooms by the fall.”

Cambridge, MA, April 22, 2009: Sugar Labs™ annonce la disponibilité pour tests de la version Bêta-1 de Sugar on a Stick. Cette version du logiciel libre Sugar Learning Platform, disponible sur www.sugarlabs.org pour téléchargement dans n’importe quelle clef USB de 1 Go ou plus, a été conçue pour permettre d’explorer la célèbre interface Sugar au-delà de sa plate-forme d’origine, le XO-1 de One Laptop per Child, sur toutes sortes d’ordinateurs, des PCs anciens aux Macintosh récents en passant par les nouveaux netbooks.

Les enseignants et parents qui veulent essayer Sugar avec des enfants peuvent télécharger le fichier bêta-1 de Sugar on a Stick sur le site web de Sugar Labs et le charger sur une clef USB en suivant les instructions sur [wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick).

Walter Bender, le directeur exécutif de Sugar Labs, a dit : “Sugar est parfaitement adapté aux élèves avec son interface simple et vivante, pensée pour le travail en commun, et avec son architecture ouverte. Sugar on a Stick vous permet de démarrer un ordinateur avec Sugar et de stocker les données de l’enfant dans la clef sans toucher au disque dur de l’ordinateur hôte. Les Activités de Sugar telles que Write, un traitement de texte partagé, et l’Activité InfoSlicer annoncé récemment, qui permet aux enseignants de collectionner et réunir facilement des contenus du web pour la classe, bénéficient pleinement des caractéristiques collaboratives de Sugar.”

Caroline Meeks de Solution Grove ([www.solutiongrove.com](http://www.solutiongrove.com)), gestionnaire du projet Sugar on a Stick, a commenté : “Nous comptons sur les enseignants pour nous aider à améliorer Sugar on a Stick tandis que nous continuons à travailler sur la Version-1 prévue pour le troisième trimestre 2009. Nous venons de présenter Sugar on a Stick à la conférence FOSS VT (<http://www.ncose.org/node/47>) où il a suscité beaucoup d’intérêt, et nos tests sur le terrain avec des PCs variés et anciens ont été très encourageants.”

Les testeurs de Sugar sont invités à envoyer des informations sur tout bogue et autres critiques constructives à l’adresse suivante : [feedback@sugarlabs.org](mailto:feedback@sugarlabs.org). “Nous ne pourrons pas répondre à chaque message,” a continué Mme Meeks, “mais nous allons lire chacun afin de rendre Sugar on a Stick un outil fiable dans les classes qui manquent de ressources d’ici la rentrée.”

LinuxTag, Berlin, June 24, 2009: Sugar Labs™, nonprofit provider of the Sugar Learning Platform to over one-million children worldwide, announces the immediate availability of Sugar on a Stick v1 Strawberry. Available free for download at [www.sugarlabs.org](http://www.sugarlabs.org), Sugar on a Stick can be loaded onto an ordinary 1GB USB flash drive and used to reboot any PC or netbook directly into the award-winning Sugar environment. It runs on recent Macs with a helper CD and in Windows using virtualization. Sugar on a Stick is designed to work with a School Server that can provide content distribution, homework collection, backup services, Moodle integration, and filtered access to the Internet. Today’s Strawberry release is meant for classroom testing; [feedback](mailto:feedback@sugarlabs.org) will be incorporated into the next version, available towards the end of 2009.

“One year after its founding, Sugar Labs is delivering on its education promise for its second million learners,” commented Walter Bender, founder and executive director. “Sugar is preferred because it is a superior learning experience for young children: engaging while being affordable. Sugar on a Stick is a great way to try Sugar without touching your computer’s hard disk. It is also well suited to slower, older PCs and low-powered netbooks. There is a version for the OLPC XO-1 and it will ship with the newer XO-1.5 laptops in the fall.”

Sugar on a Stick provides a coherent and consistent computing experience. It reduces costs by providing flexibility in hardware choices, allowing schools to keep their existing investment in hardware. Learners can benefit from the increased household ownership of computers; by bringing Sugar on a Stick home, every student has a consistent, comparable computing environment that parents can share in as well. It also provides off-line access to applications and content as not every learner has Internet access at home.

As part of an ongoing effort to make Sugar on a Stick classroom-ready, Sugar Labs has been awarded a $20,000 grant from the Gould Charitable Foundation to implement Sugar at the Gardner Pilot Academy, a public elementary school located in one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse sections of Boston, Massachusetts.

Learning Activities are at the heart of Sugar. Sugar on a Stick includes 40 Activities to interest young learners such as Read, Write, Paint, and Etoys. Hundreds more Activities are available free for download at the [Sugar Activity Library](http://activities.sugarlabs.org). Most “Sugarized” Activities have student collaboration built-in; students and teachers work, play, and learn on the same Activities together. The Sugar Learning Platform is open, so by leveraging the work of other open source projects, existing software for children can be integrated; for example, the acclaimed GCompris suite of 100 Activities developed over the past five years by Bruno Coudoin was recently added to Sugar, including Activities such as Chess, Geography, and Sudoku. Teachers and parents interested in Sugar’s Activities and its modern interface for children can watch short videos on the recently opened [Sugar Labs Dailymotion channel](http://www.dailymotion.com/sugarlabs).

Visitors to LinuxTag are welcome to speak with Sugar Labs contributors at booth 7.2a 110a.

LinuxTag, Berlin, 24 Juin 2009: Sugar Labs™, fournisseur à but non-lucratif de la plate-forme pédagogique Sugar à plus d’un million d’enfants dans le monde, annonce la disponibilité immédiate de « Sugar on a Stick v1 Strawberry » (« Bâtonnet de Sucre v1 Fraise »). Logiciel libre disponible en téléchargement gratuit sur [www.sugarlabs.org](http://www.sugarlabs.org), Sugar on a Stick peut être chargé sur une clef USB 1Gb ordinaire et utilisée pour rebooter n’importe quel PC ou netbook dans l’environnement Sugar. Celui-ci tourne sur les Macs récents avec un CD de support et dans Windows en utilisant la virtualisation. Sugar on a Stick est conçu pour marcher avec un serveur d’école qui peut dispenser des contenus, des collections de devoirs à la maison, des services de sauvegarde, l’intégration de Moodle, et un filtrage de l’accès à internet. La version « Fraise » d’aujourd’hui est destinée à être testée dans la salle de classe ; les [retours d’expérience](mailto:feedback@sugarlabs.org) seront intégrés dans la prochaine version, disponible vers la fin 2009.

« Un an après sa fondation, Sugar Labs tient ses promesses pédagogiques pour son second million d’apprenants », commente Walter Bender, fondateur et directeur exécutif. « Sugar est choisi parce qu’il permet une expérience d’apprentissage supérieure pour les jeunes enfants qui l’explorent, tout en étant abordable. Sugar on a Stick est une formidable manière de tester Sugar sans toucher au disque dur de votre ordinateur. C’est aussi bien adapté aux ordinateurs plus lents, aux vieux PCs et aux netbooks peu puissants. Il y a une version pour le XO-1 d’OLPC et cela sera expédié avec les nouveaux XO-1.5 à partir de l’automne. »

Sugar on a Stick fournit une expérience informatique cohérente et conforme. Il réduit les coûts en rendant souple les choix des matériels, permettant aux écoles de conserver leur investissement existant en matériel. Les apprenants peuvent bénéficier du taux grandissant des ordinateurs familials ; en rentrant à la maison avec Sugar on a Stick, chaque étudiant possède son environnement habituel que les parents peuvent partager aussi. Il fournit aussi un accès différé aux applications et contenus, utile pour des apprenants dépourvus d’un accès Internet à la maison.

L’effort pour rendre Sugar on a Stick prêt pour la salle de classe continue ; Sugar Labs a décerné une subvention de $20.000 de la Gould Charitable Foundation pour implémenter Sugar au Gardner Pilot Academy, une école primaire publique située dans un quartier populaire et multiculturel de Boston dans l’état de Massachusetts.

Les Activités pour apprendre sont au cœur de Sugar. Sugar on a Stick est fourni avec 40 Activités intéressantes pour des jeunes apprenants tels que Lire, Écrire, Dessiner, et EToys. Des centaines d’autres Activités sont disponibles gratuitement sur la [Bibliothèque d’Activités Sugar](http://activities.sugarlabs.org). La plupart d’activités « sucrées » offrent la collaboration en natif ; les étudiants et enseignants travaillent, jouent, et apprennent ensemble sur les mêmes Activités. La plate-forme d’apprentissage Sugar est ouverte et bénéficie des travaux d’autres projets ; des logiciels existants peuvent être intégrés. Par exemple, plus de 100 activités tels que Échecs, Géographie, et Sudoku de la suite acclamée GCompris développée depuis cinq ans par Bruno Coudoin ont été ajoutés récemment à Sugar. Des enseignants et parents qui s’intéressent aux activités de Sugar et à son interface moderne pour enfants peuvent visionner de courtes vidéos sur le nouveau canal [Dailymotion de Sugar Labs](http://www.dailymotion.com/sugarlabs).

Les visiteurs à LinuxTag sont invités à dialoguer avec des contributeurs de Sugar Labs au stand 7.2a 110a.

Berlino, 24 Giugno, 2009: Sugar Labs, la realtà no-profit che ha sviluppato la Piattaforma di Apprendimento Sugar (Sugar Learning Platform) utilizzata da più di un milione di bambini nel mondo intero, annuncia l’immediata disponibilità di "Sugar on a Stick" v1 Strawberry. Disponibile in forma libera e gratuita dal sito [www.sugarlabs.org](http://www.sugarlabs.org), Sugar on a Stick può essere caricato su una normale chiavetta USB da almeno 1Gb e utilizzandola per avviare direttamente il sistema Sugar in qualunque PC o netbook. Può essere utilizzato anche sui più recenti sistemi Mac con l’ausilio di un CD di avvio, e all’interno di sistemi Windows attraverso la virtualizzazione. “Sugar on a Stick” è stato progettato per l’utilizzo insieme ad uno School Server che fornisce distribuzione di contenuti, raccolta di elaborati, servizi di backup, integrazione con la piattaforma Moodle, e accesso protetto ad Internet. La versione odierna di “Sugar on a Stick” v1 Strawberry è pensata per la sperimentazione in classe ([feedback](mailto:feedback@sugarlabs.org)); la prossima versione sarà rilasciata entro la fine del 2009.

"Ad un anno dalla fondazione, Sugar Labs sta rilasciando quanto promesso per il suo secondo milione di studenti" commenta Walter Bender, fondatore e direttore esecutivo. "Sugar viene preferito perché offre grandi opportunità educative ai giovani allievi: attraente e di facile approccio. Sugar on a Stick è un modo eccezionalmente semplice per provare Sugar senza dover installare nulla sul proprio computer. Si tratta inoltre di una soluzione ottima per computer vecchi, lenti o per netbook non particolarmente potenti. Esiste una versione specifica per OLPC XO-1 e questa sarà la versione distribuita con i nuovi XO-1.5 laptop a partire dal prossimo autunno."

Sugar on a Stick fornisce un ambiente coerente e consistente per le attività. Permette una riduzione di costi offrendo adattabilità a molteplici soluzioni hardware, permettendo alle scuole di conservare e riutilizzare gli investimenti in hardware effettuati nel passato. Gli studenti potranno beneficiare della accresciuta possibilità di utilizzare anche a casa i propri strumenti didattici; portando a casa “Sugar on a Stick”, ogni studente ritroverà il proprio ambiente di lavoro scolastico abituale, anche utilizzando computer di famigliari. Permetterà inoltre ad ogni utilizzatore di continuare a utilizzare le proprie applicazioni e contenuti anche off-line, posto che non tutti possano disporre di connessioni ad internet a casa.

Come supporto allo sforzo di rendere “Sugar on a Stick” pronto per l’utilizzo in classe, Sugar Labs ha ricevuto un sussidio di $20,000 da parte della Gould Charitable Foundation per rilasciare Sugar presso la Gardner Pilot Academy, una scuola elementare pubblica situata in una delle aree di Boston, Massachusetts, caratterizzata da una grande varietà culturale e linguistica.

Le Attività di Apprendimento sono il cuore di Sugar. “Sugar on a Stick” include 40 attività preinstallate per catturare l’interesse dei giovani studenti, fra queste Leggi, Scrivi, Disegna, e l’ambiente Etoys. Altre centinaia di attività sono disponibili per essere liberamente scaricate dalla [Sugar Activity Library](http://activities.sugarlabs.org). La maggior parte delle attività "Sugarized" possiedono funzionalità di collaborazione native; gli studenti ed i docenti possono lavorare, giocare ed imparare tutti insieme condividendo le stesse attività. La “Sugar Learning Platform” è aperta, quindi approfittando del lavoro di altri progetti OpenSource, software didattico per bambini già esistente può essere integrato; per esempio, la famosa suite GCompris comprendente più di 100 attività didattiche e ludiche sviluppata nel corso degli scorsi cinque anni da Bruno Coudoin è stata recentemente integrata, comprendendo fra le altre Attività come Scacchi, Geografia e Sudoku. Docenti e genitori interessati a valutare le attività di Sugar e la sua innovativa interfaccia utente specificamente progettata per i bambini possono visionare i filmati disponibili sul canale recentemente attivato da [Sugar Labs su Dailymotion](http://www.dailymotion.com/sugarlabs).

I partecipanti a LinuxTag sono caldamente invitati ad incontrare i collaboratori di Sugar Labs presso lo stand 7.2a 110a.

LinuxTag, Berlín, 24 de junio de 2009: Sugar Labs™, proveedor sin fines de lucro de la plataforma de aprendizaje de Sugar a más de un millón de niños en todo el mundo, anuncia la disponibilidad inmediata de Sugar on a Stick (SoaS) v1 Strawberry (Fresa). Disponible para su descarga gratuita en [www.sugarlabs.org](www.sugarlabs.org), SoaS se puede cargar en una pendrive USB de 1 GB y se utiliza para reiniciar casi cualquier PC, o usar directamente en el portátil y entrar a Sugar, el ambiente premiado de aprendizaje. Funciona en los últimos equipos Mac con la ayuda de un CD y en Windows usando la virtualización.

Sugar on a Stick está diseñado para trabajar con un servidor de colegio que puede proporcionar la distribución de contenidos, el recojo de tareas, los servicios de copia de seguridad, la integración de Moodle y la filtración del acceso a Internet. El Strawberry de hoy está listo para probarse en las escuelas. [Comentarios](mailto:feedback@sugarlabs.org) se incorporarán en la próxima versión, disponible a finales de 2009.

"Un año después de su fundación, Sugar Labs está cumpliendo su promesa de educación para su segundo millón de estudiantes", comentó Walter Bender, fundador y director ejecutivo. "Sugar es preferido porque ofrece una excelente experiencia de aprendizaje para los niños pequeños: divertida y económica. Sugar on a Stick es una gran manera de probar Sugar sin tocar el disco duro de la computadora. También es muy adecuado para las computadoras más lentas, más antiguas y para las portátiles pequeñas de baja potencia. Existe una versión para la OLPC XO-1 y se suministrará con las nuevas computadoras portátiles XO-1.5 en el otoño."

Sugar on a Stick ofrece una experiencia coherente y consistente. Reduce costos, proporcionando flexibilidad en opciones de tipos de computadoras, permitiendo que las escuelas mantengan sus inversiones existentes en sus aparatos. Para los que tienen computadora en casa, pueden llevar el Sugar on a Stick consigo. Cada estudiante tiene un ambiente de computación coherente y comparable que los padres pueden compartir también. Además, proporciona acceso fuera de línea a aplicaciones y contenido para los alumnos que no tienen acceso a Internet en casa.

Como parte de un esfuerzo continuo para hacer Sugar on a Stick listo para las aulas, Sugar Labs ha recibido una subvención de 20.000 dólares de la Fundación de Beneficencia Gould para aplicar un proyecto piloto de Sugar en la Academia Gardner, una escuela primaria ubicada en una de las más cultural y lingüísticamente diversas secciones de Boston, Massachusetts.

Actividades dirigidas al aprendizaje están en el corazón de Sugar. Sugar on a Stick incluye 40 actividades de interés para los jóvenes estudiantes tales como Leer, Escribir, Pintura y Etoys. Cientos de actividades están disponibles para su descarga gratuita en la [biblioteca de Actividades de Sugar](http://activities.sugarlabs.org). La mayoría de las actividades "Sugarized" han incorporado la colaboración de estudiantes. Los alumnos y profesores trabajan, juegan y aprenden juntos en las mismas actividades.

La plataforma de aprendizaje de Sugar es abierta. Por lo tanto, Sugar utiliza el trabajo de otros proyectos de código abierto. El software existente para los niños se puede integrar a Sugar. Por ejemplo, el reconocido GCompris, junto con 100 actividades desarrolladas en los últimos cinco años por Bruno Coudoin, fueron añadidos recientemente a Sugar; incluye actividades como Ajedrez, Geografía y Sudoku. Los maestros y padres de familia interesados en las Actividades de Sugar y su interfaz moderna pueden ver videos cortos en el recientemente inaugurado canal de [Sugar Labs Dailymotion](http://www.dailymotion.com/sugarlabs).

LinuxTag, Berlin, 24. Juni 2009: Sugar Labs™, gemeinnütziger Anbieter der Sugar-Lernplattform, die weltweit von über einer Million Kindern benutzt wird, gibt die Veröffentlichung von Sugar on a Stick v1 Strawberry bekannt. Frei zum Download auf [www.sugarlabs.org](www.sugarlabs.org) verfügbar, lässt sich Sugar on a Stick auf einen gewöhnlichen 1GB-USB-Stick laden, von dem aus ein PC oder Netbook direkt in die preisgekrönte Sugar-Umgebung gebootet werden kann. Es läuft auf neuen Macs mit einer Hilfs-CD und unter Windows mittels Virtualisierung. Sugar on a Stick ist für den Betrieb mit einem Schulserver ausgelegt, der die Verteilung von Materialien, das Einsammeln von Hausaufgaben, Datensicherung, Moodle-Anbindung und gefilterten Zugriff auf das Internet bieten kann. Die gegenwärtige Strawberry-Version ist zum Testen im Klassenzimmer gedacht. [Rückmeldungen](mailto:feedback@sugarlabs.org) werden in die nächste Version einfließen, die ende 2009 verfügbar sein wird.

"Ein Jahr nach seiner Gründung arbeitet Sugar Labs an der Auslieferung seiner Bildungszusage an die zweite Million Lernender", so Walter Bender, Gründer und Geschäftsführer. "Sugar wird bevorzugt, weil es kleinen Kindern eine überragende Lernerfahrung bietet: faszinierend und doch erschwinglich. Sugar on a Stick stellt eine wunderbare Möglichkeit dar, Sugar auszuprobieren, ohne die Festplatte des Rechners zu verändern. Es eignet sich auch gut für langsamere, ältere Rechner oder schwachbrüstige Netbooks. Es gibt eine Version für den OLPC XO-1 und es wird auf den neueren XO-1.5-Laptops diesen Herbst zu finden sein."

Sugar on a Stick bietet eine schlüssige und einheitliche Computererfahrung. Es mindert die Kosten durch hohe Flexibilität bei der Hardware-Auswahl, was es Schulen ermöglicht, bereits vorhandene Hardware weiterhin zu nutzen. Die Lernenden können von der zunehmenden Verbreitung von Rechnern in den Haushalten profitieren: Dadurch, dass sich Sugar on a Stick mit nach Hause nehmen lässt, steht jedem Schüler eine einheitliche, vergleichbare Computerumgebung zur Verfügung, die seine Eltern ebenso nutzen können. Auch ermöglicht es Offline-Zugang zu Anwendungen und Materialien, nachdem nicht jeder Lernende zu Hause über einen Internet-Zugang verfügt.

Als Teil der andauernden Bemühungen, Sugar on a Stick für den Einsatz im Klassenzimmer bereit zu machen, wurde Sugar Labs ein 20.000$-Zuschuss der Gould Charitable Foundation zuerkannt, um Sugar an der Gardner Pilot Academy zu implementieren, einer öffentlichen Grundschule in einem der kulturell und sprachlich vielfältigsten Viertel Bostons in Massachusetts, USA.

Lernaktivitäten bilden das Herzstück von Sugar. Sugar on a Stick umfasst 40 Aktivitäten, um das Interesse junger Lernender zu wecken, beispielsweise Lesen, Schreiben, Malen oder Etoys. Hunderte weiterer Aktivitäten stehen in der [Sugar-Aktivitätenbibliothek](http://activities.sugarlabs.org) zum freien Download bereit. Die meisten "ver-Sugar-ten" Aktivitäten ermöglichen die Zusammenarbeit von Schülern: Schüler und Lehrer arbeiten, spielen und lernen gemeinsam in denselben Aktivitäten. Die Sugar-Lernplattform ist offen, sodass durch Einsatz anderer Open-Source-Produkte vorhandene Software für Kinder integriert werden kann. So wurde etwa die gefeierte GCompris-Suite aus 100 Aktivitäten, die die letzten fünf Jahre über von Bruno Coudoin entwickelt wurde, erst kürzlich zu Sugar hinzugefügt, darunter Aktivitäten wie Schach, Geographie oder Sudoku. Lehrer und Eltern, die sich für Sugars Aktivitäten und sein modernes Interface für Kinder interessieren, finden im unlängst eröffneten [Sugar Labs Dailymotion-Kanal](http://www.dailymotion.com/sugarlabs) kurze Videos.

Besucher des LinuxTages sind herzlich eingeladen, mit Beitragenden zu Sugar Labs am Stand 7.2a 110a zu sprechen.

LinuxTag, Berlijn, 24 juni 2009: Sugar Labs™ is de non-profit organisatie die het Sugar Leerplatform levert aan meer dan één miljoen kinderen over de hele wereld. Zij kondigt aan dat nu Sugar on a Stick versie 1 beschikbaar is onder de naam **"Strawberry"**. Het is gratis op te halen bij [www.sugarlabs.org](http://www.sugarlabs.org) en te installeren op een 1 GB flash drive. Daarna kan Sugar direct worden opgestart op een PC of netbook. Het draait ook op recente Macs met een hulp-CD en in Windows met gebruik van virtualisatie.

Sugar on a Stick is ontworpen in combinatie met een School Server, waarmee het volgende kan worden verzorgd: distributie van informatie/leerstof, huiswerk verzamelen, backups maken, integratie met Moodle en gefilterde toegang tot het internet. Deze "Strawberry"-versie is bedoeld om in de klas te testen; feedback zal in de volgende versie worden opgenomen en komt tegen het einde van 2009 beschikbaar.

> "Eén jaar na oprichting maakt Sugar Labs haar beloften waar voor haar tweede miljoen studenten," zegt Walter Bender, oprichter en directeur.  
> "Sugar heeft de voorkeur, want het is een superieure leeromgeving voor jonge kinderen: motiverend en betaalbaar. Sugar on a Stick is een geweldige manier om het uit te proberen zonder de harde schijf te veranderen. Het is ook geschikt voor oudere pc’s en langzamere netbooks. Er is een versie voor de OLPC XO-1 en het zal geleverd worden met de nieuwere XO-1.5 laptops in de herfst."

Sugar on a Stick geeft een samenhangend en consistente werkomgeving. Het vermindert kosten doordat het op veel hardware kan worden geïnstalleerd, zodat scholen hun bestaande apparatuur kunnen blijven gebruiken. Het komt de leerlingen ten goede dat zij hun vertrouwde Sugar on a Stick-omgeving mee naar huis kunnen nemen en het ook kunnen delen met hun ouders. Het geeft ook offline toegang tot hun activiteiten en leerstof, daar niet iedere leerling thuis internet heeft.

Als onderdeel van een voortdurende inspanning om Sugar on a Stick klaar te maken voor de klas, heeft Sugar Labs een donatie van **$20.000** ontvangen van de Gould Charitable Foundation om Sugar te installeren op de Gardner Pilot Academy, een openbare basisschool in een wijk van Boston, Massachusetts met één van de grootste verscheidenheid aan achtergronden qua cultuur en taal.

Leeractiviteiten zijn het hart van Sugar. Sugar on a Stick bevat **veertig activiteiten** voor jonge leerlingen zoals lezen, schrijven, tekenen en eToys. Er zijn nog honderden andere activiteiten gratis op te halen bij de [Sugar Activiteiten Bibliotheek](http://activities.sugarlabs.org). De meeste van deze activiteiten hebben samenwerking ingebouwd: leerlingen en onderwijskrachten werken, spelen en leren samen.

Het Sugar Leerplatform is open, dus andere bestaande open-sourceprojecten voor kinderen kunnen erin geïntegreerd worden. Zo is de bekende **GCompris-suite** van honderd activiteiten onlangs toegevoegd aan Sugar, met activiteiten als schaken, aardrijkskunde en sudoku. Dit project werd de afgelopen vijf jaar door **Bruno Coudoin** ontwikkeld.

Leerkrachten en ouders die geïnteresseerd zijn in Sugar-activiteiten en de moderne interface voor kinderen kunnen korte video’s bekijken op het onlangs geopende [Sugar Labs Dailymotion-kanaal](http://www.dailymotion.com/sugarlabs).

Bezoekers aan LinuxTag zijn welkom bij stand **7.2a 110a** om te komen praten met Sugar Labs-medewerkers.`,Nn=Object.freeze(Object.defineProperty({__proto__:null,default:M},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"})),_=`---

CAMBRIDGE, MA, September 18, 2009 — Sugar Labs, nonprofit provider of the Sugar Learning Platform for children, and the Free Software Foundation (FSF), which promotes computer users’ right to use, study, copy, modify, and redistribute computer programs, have announced joint efforts to collaborate and promote Sugar on the occasion of **Software Freedom Day**, September 19th.

The FSF will host an event in Boston featuring Sugar Labs Executive Director **Walter Bender**, FSF president **Richard Stallman**, and other speakers. **Peter Brown**, FSF’s executive director, said:

> “The Sugar Learning Platform is fast becoming an essential route to computer user freedom for children around the world. The international free software movement is getting behind Sugar, and we want to use Software Freedom Day as an opportunity to help draw community attention, developer resources, and external funders to the important work going on at Sugar Labs.”

The FSF has upgraded its hosting services support of Sugar Labs to keep pace with its growth. As part of the ongoing relationship, **Bernardo Innocenti**, a member of the Sugar Labs Oversight Board, is working at the FSF offices. Mr. Innocenti stated:

> “The FSF and Sugar Labs are pursuing distinct, but interdependent goals; Free (as in Freedom) Software is a fundamental part of globally accessible education, and good education enables critical thought, a pre-requisite for appreciating the value of Freedom.”

Sugar is a global project. Translated into **25 languages**, it is used in classrooms in **40 countries** by over **1 million children** as part of the **One Laptop per Child (OLPC)** nonprofit program. Sugar’s simple interface, built-in collaboration, and automatic backup through each student’s Journal have been designed to interest young learners.

The recently released **Sugar on a Stick (SoaS)** project brings Sugar to even more children, allowing young learners to keep a working copy of Sugar on a simple USB stick, ready to start up any PC or netbook with the child’s environment and data. Pilot projects in schools with Sugar on a Stick are underway in **Boston**, **Berlin**, and elsewhere.

SoaS is **free software** available under the **General Public License (GPL)** and is available for download without charge at [sugarlabs.org](http://www.sugarlabs.org).

According to Walter Bender:

> “Sugar is running on over 99% of all of the OLPC-XO laptops around the world because governments prefer its quality, openness, built-in collaboration, and easy localization to indigenous languages. Teachers and students are exercising their freedom by modifying and improving Sugar and its Activities. With Sugar on a Stick, access to Sugar is even more widespread.”

For example, **Uruguay** has distributed a Sugar-equipped OLPC laptop to every student in the country. [Alexandre Oliva of FSF’s sister organization Free Software Foundation Latin America](http://www.fsfla.org) said:

> “I was amazed when I first saw Sugar in action in Peru two years ago; shortly thereafter, my daughter tasted Sugar and loved it. She’s going to elementary school next year, and I’m very happy she can now easily carry Sugar with her, and share it with her friends. Myself, I’m going to spread its freedom into as many schools as I can.”

**Karsten Gerloff**, President of [Free Software Foundation Europe](http://fsfe.org), added:

> “Education and Free Software are both all about sharing knowledge. Through projects like Sugar, young people around the world can discover the creativity that freedom makes possible. Together with the political backing that FSFE’s Edu-Team and others are building, Sugar puts Free Software in its rightful place in education.”

Sugar Labs relies on the efforts of **software developers** who donate their skills to the project. Mr. Bender continued:

> “We are looking for developers with experience in GNU/Linux, Python and/or Gtk+ for contributing to the Sugar shell and educational Activities for children. We also need testers, experienced packagers, and educators willing to contribute their ideas for Sugar in the classroom.”`,Un=Object.freeze(Object.defineProperty({__proto__:null,default:_},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"})),x=`---

PARIS, December 8, 2009 — Netbook World Summit — Sugar Labs® (R), volunteer-driven nonprofit provider of the Sugar Learning Platform for over one million children around the world, announces the release of Sugar on a Stick v2 “Blueberry.” Available for download at [http://www.sugarlabs.org](http://www.sugarlabs.org), Sugar on a Stick can be loaded onto any ordinary 1GB or greater flash drive to reboot any PC, netbook or recent Mac directly into the child-friendly Sugar environment without touching the existing installation. 

Sugar is also available for GNU/Linux distributions, runs under virtualization on Windows and Apple OS X, and features built-in classroom collaboration and automatic backup to a Journal. The latest version of Sugar offers simpler navigation, improved wireless networking, streamlined updating of Activities for children, easier keyboard configuration, better Gnash support for Adobe Flash content, and more. New Activities such as Physics and OOo4Kids join updated favorites such as Browse and Read, suitable for reading e-books.

“Sugar on a Stick is a great way to experience Sugar,” commented Walter Bender, Sugar Labs executive director. “In this holiday season, we wish to remind parents and teachers that e-books are not only for costly reader units for the well-to-do, but freely available as part of the open-access to knowledge movement to help children everywhere develop critical learning skills and to bridge the digital divide wherever it exists.”

Sugar on a Stick includes several e-book reader Activities to find and display e-books in PDF, EPUB, and DejaVu formats. The Read Etexts Activity can read e-books out loud, converting any old PC or inexpensive netbook into a text-to-speech aid for disabled readers. With Sugar, children can even make their own e-books. Thousands of e-books for children are available on websites such as Project Gutenberg, the Internet Archive Children’s Library, epubBooks.com, Feedbooks.com, and ManyBooks.net. Other sites offer online reading, such as the International Children’s Digital Library.

Pilot Sugar projects are underway in American and European schools. School administrators wishing to deploy Sugar will be interested in OLPC’s recently updated XS school server software, which provides “safety net” and connectivity services at the school level: backup, content distribution, filtered access to the Internet, and Moodle integration. 

To assist schools interested in testing this technology, Sugar Labs has partnered with Nexcopy, Inc. of Rancho Santa Margarita, California, an industry leader in USB duplicator solutions, to open [http://recycleusb.com](http://recycleusb.com). Nexcopy will collect used USB sticks, reload them with Sugar on a Stick, and forward them to Sugar Labs for distribution to schools. Nexcopy has also donated a 20-stick USB duplication unit to Sugar Labs.

Greg Morris, President of Nexcopy, commented, “Nexcopy is proud to partner with a nonprofit organization such as Sugar Labs. We believe the Sugar Learning Platform is clearly a step in the right direction for getting children involved with personal computers. Our objective is to give Sugar Labs the back-end equipment support needed to make this philanthropy successful and help with producing the large number of Sugar Sticks needed for global deployment. I am very honored Nexcopy is a part of this process.”

CAMBRIDGE, Mass, 29 avril 2010 - L'Office de secours et travaux des Nations unies pour les réfugiés de Palestine au proche orient ([UNRWA](http://www.unrwa.org)) a annoncé un programme ambitieux de 3 ans pour fournir à un demi-million d'enfants réfugiés Palestinien, dans la bande de Gaza, au Liban, en Syrie et en Jordanie, un ordinateur équipé de la plateforme éducative Sugar, plusieurs fois primée.

"Motiver la prochaine génération en lui donnant l'accès à la connaissance et à l'apprentissage est capital pour les projets éducatifs de l'UNRWA. Nous enseignons à 500 000 enfants au Proche Orient chaque jour et donner à chacun d'entre eux un ordinateur sera une énorme contribution pour combler le fossé technologique et d'accès au savoir dans l'une des régions les plus troublée du monde", a indiqué Chris Gunness, le porte-parole de l'UNWRA.

Selon Walter Bender, fondateur et directeur exécutif du Sugar Labs: "Aujourd'hui, de la forêt vierge du Pérou aux steppes de Mongolie, des collines du Rwanda aux montages d'Afghanistan, un million et demi d'enfants apprennent chacun dans leur langue maternelle, sur les ordinateurs XO du projet OLPC grâce à Sugar et sa suite d'Activités d'apprentissage. Le projet de l'UNRWA ajoutera un demi-million d'apprenants supplémentaires en provenance de la vallée de Jordanie et du Moyen Orient, et d'autres projets vont voir le jour prochainement. C'est une génération entière qui apprend avec Sugar."

Le cœur de Sugar, ce sont ses Activités pour les enfants ([http://activities.sugarlabs.org](http://activities.sugarlabs.org)). Amusant et motivant, ce sont des programmes qui permettent de lire des livres électroniques, d'écrire, de dessiner, de naviguer sur Internet, de programmer et plein d'autres choses. Sugar intègre de plus le travail collaboratif et l'enregistrement des activités réalisées dans le journal ce qui le rend particulièrement adapté à l'utilisation en classe mais aussi en dehors de l'école pour continuer les apprentissages. Complété par un serveur d'école XS, un logiciel libre et ouvert proposé par le projet One Laptop Per Child, il permet de fournir aux jeunes apprenants un environnement connecté sûr et sécurisé.

Les contenus existant de l'UNRWA seront adaptés à Sugar et la formation des enseignants va démarrer prochainement. Le projet de l'UNRWA fait suite au déploiement l'année dernière de 1000 ordinateurs XO dans les écoles Palestinienne par le PEI (Palestine Education Initiative [http://www.pei.gov.ps](http://www.pei.gov.ps), [http://en.palexo.com](http://en.palexo.com)). Sugar Labs est à la recherche de développeurs et de volontaires pour faire de ce projet un vrai succès.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., 29 Aprile, 2010 — L'Agenzia delle Nazioni Unite per i rifugiati della Palestina nel Medio Oriente ([UNRWA](http://www.unrwa.org)) ha annunciato un ambizioso programma triennale per fornire un computer portatile dotato del premiato ambiente software Sugar Learning Platform a mezzo milione di bambini palestinesi rifugiati nella Striscia di Gaza, Libano, Siria, e Giordania.

“Rafforzare la prossima generazione grazie a conoscenza e capacità di apprendimento è l'aspetto centrale per progetti educativi dell'UNRWA. Ogni giorno forniamo istruzione a 500.000 bambini nel Medio Oriente e fornire ad ognuno di loro un laptop sarà un grande aiuto a chiudere il gap di conoscenza e tecnologie in una delle regioni del mondo con maggiori problemi,” dice Chris Gunness, portavoce dell'UNRWA.

Walter Bender, fondatore e Direttore Esecutivo di Sugar Labs, dichiara: “Ad oggi, un milione e mezzo di bambini, dalle foreste equatoriali del Perù alle steppe della Mongolia, dalle colline del Rwanda alle montagne dell'Afganistan, stanno imparando, utilizzando la loro lingua madre grazie a Sugar e alla collezione di Attività didattiche con i laptop XO di OLPC. Il progetto di UNRWA accrescerà di un altro mezzo milione di studenti nella valle del Giordano e nel Medio Oriente, altri progetti sono in sviluppo. Una intera nuova generazione sta apprendendo con Sugar.”

Al cuore di Sugar sono le Attività: [http://activities.sugarlabs.org](http://activities.sugarlabs.org) – programmi divertenti e appassionanti, nati per leggere libri elettronici, scrivere, disegnare, navigare la rete Internet, programmare, e molto altro ancora. Sugar integra capacità di collaborazione fra utenti e di memorizzazione dei dati in una struttura organizzata in base temporale (Diario), funzionalità estremamente adatte sia ad un utilizzo in classe che per continuare ad apprendere e studiare anche al di fuori della scuola. Il sistema XS School Server, basato su software libero, reso disponibile da One Laptop per Child, permette un accesso sicuro e filtrato alla rete Internet per i giovani studenti.

I materiali didattici di UNRWA esistenti saranno adattati a Sugar e si sta già provvedendo anche alla formazione dei docenti. Il progetto di UNRWA segue le orme della distribuzione avvenuta lo scorso anno di 1000 laptops XO nelle scuole della Palestina a cura della Palestine Education Initiative ([http://www.pei.gov.ps](http://www.pei.gov.ps), [http://en.palexo.com](http://en.palexo.com)).

CAMBRIDGE, Mass, April 29, 2010 - The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA, [http://www.unrwa.org](http://www.unrwa.org)) has announced an ambitious three-year program to provide a laptop loaded with the award-winning Sugar Learning Platform to one-half million Palestine refugee children in the West Bank and Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan.

“Empowering the next generation through knowledge and learning is central to UNRWA’s education projects. We are teaching 500,000 children in the Middle East every day and having all of them with a laptop will be a huge contribution to bridging the technology and knowledge gap in one of the most troubled regions of the world,” said Chris Gunness, UNWRA Spokesman.

Walter Bender, founder and Executive Director of Sugar Labs, said: “Today, one-and-one-half-million children, from the rain forests of Peru to the steppes of Mongolia, from the hills of Rwanda to the mountains of Afghanistan, are learning in their native tongues with Sugar and its suite of learning Activities on OLPC’s XO laptops. The UNRWA project will add one-half million more learners in the Jordan valley and throughout the Middle East, and more projects are on the way. An entire generation is learning with Sugar.”

The heart of Sugar is its Activities for children ([http://activities.sugarlabs.org](http://activities.sugarlabs.org)), fun and engaging programs for reading e-books, writing, drawing, browsing the Internet, programming, and so on. Sugar has collaboration and backup to a Journal built-in, making it particularly well-suited both for the classroom and outside school where learning continues. The free open source XS School Server, available from One Laptop per Child, provides a safely filtered online environment for young learners.

Existing UNRWA learning content will be adapted to Sugar and teacher training is underway. The UNRWA project follows last year’s deployment of 1000 XO laptops in Palestinian schools by the Palestine Education Initiative ([http://www.pei.gov.ps](http://www.pei.gov.ps), [http://en.palexo.com](http://en.palexo.com)). Sugar Labs welcomes developers and volunteers to make this important endeavor successful.

ASUNCIÓN, 14 de junio de 2010 — Sugar Labs, el Proyecto de Escritorio Libre GNOME, y One Laptop per Child (OLPC) han anunciado una actualización del software que se ofrece en el OLPC XO-1.5. Los 1,5 millones de niños que ya usan Sugar en el XO-1 original también podrán beneficiarse de la actualización ya que Paraguay Educa ha portado el software.

La plataforma de aprendizaje Sugar promueve el aprendizaje colaborativo a través de Actividades amigables para los niños que fomentan el pensamiento crítico. El escritorio libre GNOME es un componente distinguido de todas las principales distribuciones de GNU/Linux, adecuado para niños mayores y adultos. El cambio entre los dos entornos se realiza con un único click. Con GNOME en el portátil XO, se abre la puerta a miles de aplicaciones de formación y de productividad adicionales.

El XO-1.5 tiene el mismo diseño industrial que el XO-1 original. Está basado en un procesador VIA, que proporciona el doble de velocidad que el XO-1, y tiene 4 veces más de memoria DRAM y memoria FLASH. OLPC ha anunciado la disponibilidad de una edición para secundaria del XO-1.5, el XO-HS High School Edition, con un diseño de teclado nuevo, más cómodo para los estudiantes mayores. El primer despliegue del XO-HS está programado para empezar en Uruguay en el marco del exitoso Plan Ceibal a partir de septiembre.

Los niños familiarizados con el XO-1 evolucionarán naturalmente a las funcionalidades ampliadas del XO-1.5. "One Laptop per Child promueve software libre y de código abierto para que pueda evolucionar y adaptarse a las necesidades de los niños. La plataforma Sugar en el XO es clave para nuestra misión educativa porque proporciona a los estudiantes un entorno de software de aprendizaje único e intuitivo", dijo el director ejecutivo de la asociación OLPC Rodrigo Arboleda.

Stormy Peters, Directora Ejecutiva de la GNOME Foundation, dice: “Estamos muy entusiasmados de estar trabajando con Sugar y OLPC para proveer software de escritorio para niños de todas las edades. La misión de GNOME es proporcionar un escritorio libre y accesible para todos. Los niños, desde Uruguay hasta Ghana, serán capaces de utilizar sus XO para aprender y mostrar a sus amigos y familias cómo usar Sugar y GNOME."

Walter Bender, director ejecutivo de Sugar Labs, dijo que "la fluidez de cambio entre los dos escritorios ofrece al alumno la capacidad de transición de un entorno de aprendizaje —Sugar— a un entorno de producción —GNOME—. Así disponen de los medios para perfeccionar las habilidades creativas adquiridas en educación primaria, con las capacidades emprendedoras de la educación secundaria".

“Sugar on a Stick” permite a los niños que no tienen un ordenador portátil XO beneficiarse de este nuevo software. Disponible para descarga desde Sugar Labs, en la nueva distribución v3 Mirabelle, puede ser cargada en un pendrive USB común y usarse para iniciar Sugar en una PC sin tocar el disco duro. Las laptops XO y Sugar on a Stick ejecutan Fedora GNU/Linux.

BERLIN, June 10, 2010 — LinuxTag — Sugar Labs®, nonprofit provider of the Sugar Learning Platform to over one and a half million children worldwide, has released Mirabelle, the third version of Sugar on a Stick, a collaborative learning environment that can be loaded onto any ordinary USB thumbdrive and used with a PC, netbook or Mac without touching the hard disk. It is available free for download at [https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick). Sugar runs natively on major GNU/Linux distributions and can also run in virtualization under Microsoft Windows and Apple OS X.

One year after the premiere of v1 Strawberry at LinuxTag 2009 and following v2 Blueberry last December, v3 Mirabelle brings improved stability and simplified customization to curious teachers interested in testing Sugar on new netbooks or PCs already in the classroom. We suggest teachers reach out to university-level computer science and education schools to build local support structures, important with an ICT project.

Sebastian Dziallas, Project Lead for Sugar on a Stick and a recent high school graduate based in Germany, said, "Teachers have told us how important reliability is in the classroom while engaging students, so we decided to create a release that has a stable core and can be customized to fit every deployment's needs. Mirabelle is a solid baseline which teachers can customize with Activities interesting to young learners. Part of our strategy is to achieve sustainable development while inviting new contributors. We achieved this by integrating Sugar on a Stick more closely with Fedora, the underlying GNU/Linux distribution; Mirabelle is now an official Fedora Spin."

Sugar Labs is also making available a Sugar Creation Kit, a downloadable DVD which includes Mirabelle, documentation, and a library of Sugar Activities, fun and engaging programs for children taken from the [Sugar Activity Library](http://activities.sugarlabs.org).

Thomas Gilliard, a Sugar Labs contributor, said, "The Sugar Creation Kit turns any PC into a Sugar on a Stick generating station. Tools and documentation are gathered on one disk; busy teachers don't have to hunt down anything. This makes it possible to work via 'sneaker net' and in a classroom behind a firewall."

Visitors to LinuxTag are invited to meet Sugar Labs contributors at Hall 7.2a, Booth 115.

**BERLINO, 10 Giugno, 2010 — LinuxTag** — Sugar Labs®, il produttore nonprofit della Sugar Learning Platform utilizzata da più di un milione e mezzo di bambini nel mondo, ha rilasciato *Mirabelle*, la terza versione di Sugar on a Stick, una piattaforma collaborativa di apprendimento che può essere caricata su un normale disco rimovibile USB e utilizzata su un PC, netbook o Mac senza alcuna modifica al disco rigido del sistema ospite. È liberamente disponibile per il download all'indirizzo [https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick).  
Sugar funziona in modo nativo sulle principali distribuzioni GNU/Linux e attraverso la virtualizzazione su Microsoft Windows e Apple OS X.

Esattamente un anno dopo la premiere della v1 Strawberry al LinuxTag 2009 e dopo la v2 Blueberry resa disponibile lo scorso dicembre, la v3 Mirabelle presenta maggior stabilità e una più facile personalizzazione per gli insegnanti interessati a sperimentare Sugar sui nuovi netbook o PC eventualmente già presenti in classe. Suggeriamo agli insegnanti di contattare facoltà universitarie di informatica ed educazione per costruire strutture di supporto locali, fondamentali per un progetto ICT.

Sebastian Dziallas, Project Leader di Sugar on a Stick e neodiplomato residente in Germania, dichiara:  
> “Gli insegnanti ci hanno detto quanto l'affidabilità sia fondamentale lavorando in classe con gli studenti, quindi abbiamo deciso di creare una versione caratterizzata da un core affidabile e che potesse poi essere personalizzata per soddisfare qualsiasi esigenza di rilascio.  
> Mirabelle è una base solida che gli insegnanti possono personalizzare con le Attività maggiormente interessanti per i loro giovani studenti.  
> La nostra strategia è mirata anche a sviluppare la piattaforma grazie alla collaborazione di nuovi contributori. Abbiamo ottenuto questo grazie anche alla integrazione più stretta di Sugar on a Stick con Fedora, la distribuzione GNU/Linux su cui è basato; Mirabelle ora è un Fedora Spin ufficiale.”

Sugar Labs rende inoltre disponibile un **Sugar Creation Kit**, un DVD scaricabile che include Mirabelle, documentazione e una completa libreria di Attività Sugar, programmi divertenti ed interessanti estratti dalla Sugar Activity Library disponibile online ([http://activities.sugarlabs.org](http://activities.sugarlabs.org)).

Thomas Gilliard, un contributore di Sugar Labs, commenta:  
> “Il *Sugar Creation Kit* trasforma ogni PC in una stazione in grado di produrre istanze di Sugar on a Stick. Strumenti e documentazione sono tutti raccolti in un unico disco; gli insegnanti non perderanno tempo nella ricerca di quanto possa essere utile alla loro attività didattica.  
> Questo strumento permette inoltre di lavorare via 'sneaker net' (non connessi a Internet) e in aule protette da firewall.”

Berlin, le 10 juin 2010 - LinuxTag - Sugar Labs, organisation à but non lucratif à l’origine du développement de la plateforme éducative Sugar (déjà utilisée par plus de 1,5 millions d’enfants dans le monde), a dévoilé la troisième version de Sugar on a Stick, «Mirabelle», qui offre un environnement d’apprentissage collaboratif, utilisable depuis un PC, un netbook ou un Mac, sans aucune manipulation sur le système d’exploitation d’origine installé sur son disque, en utilisant une simple clé USB préchargée. Sugar on a Stick est téléchargeable à l’adresse suivante : [https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick). Le programme Sugar fonctionne nativement avec la majorité des distributions GNU/Linux et peut être également utilisé depuis une machine virtuelle sur environnement Microsoft Windows ou Apple OS X.

Un an après la première version de Sugar on a Stick («Strawberry») présentée lors de la conférence LinuxTag 2009 et suivi par «Blueberry» en décembre dernier, la nouvelle version «Mirabelle» apporte une meilleure stabilité et améliore les possibilités de personnalisation du système qui est offerte aux enseignants curieux et désireux d’utiliser Sugar sur les ordinateurs déjà présents en classe. D’ailleurs, nous recommandons vivement aux enseignants de développer autour de leur projet les différentes interactions et les échanges, en particulier avec le milieu universitaire autour de l’information ou des sciences de l’éducation. C’est un élément essentiel pour mener à bien un projet TICE.

Sebastian Dziallas, chef de projet Sugar on a Stick, et étudiant allemand récemment diplômé rapporte que «les enseignants nous ont dit à quel point la fiabilité du programme est importante lorsqu’il est utilisé par les élèves en classe. C’est pour cela que nous avons décidé de rendre disponible une version avec un noyau stable et qui soit adaptable facilement à son environnement. Mirabelle est une version avec laquelle les enseignants pourront adapter les Activités en fonction des intérêts des enfants. De plus, une partie de notre stratégie consiste à faire naître un schéma de développement durable en invitant de nouvelles personnes à contribuer au projet. Nous avons aussi pu proposer les nouveautés de Mirabelle en optimisant la base de Sugar, la distribution GNU/Linux Fedora. Mirabelle est donc officiellement dérivée de Fedora, un Fedora Spin.»

Sugar Labs a également rendu disponible le «Sugar Creation Kit», un DVD qui comprend Mirabelle, la documentation associée ainsi qu’un ensemble d’Activités pour Sugar, parmi les plus amusantes et attrayantes, aussi disponibles également en téléchargement sur le Sugar Activity Library ([http://activities.sugarlabs.org](http://activities.sugarlabs.org)).

Thomas Gilliard, un des contributeurs à Sugar Labs explique que «Le Sugar Creation Kit permet de transformer n’importe quel PC en un poste capable de configurer des clés Sugar On A Stick. Les outils et la documentation nécessaire sont déjà présents sur le DVD si bien que les enseignants ne perdront pas de temps à rechercher une information, même derrière un pare-feu, sans avoir à se connecter au réseau».

Sugar Labs sera présent pour toute la durée du salon LinuxTag 2010 au stand 115, Hall 7.2a.

ASUNCIÓN, le 14 juin 2010 – Sugar Labs, le projet d'interface bureautique libre GNOME, et la fondation One Laptop per Child (OLPC) ont annoncé conjointement une mise à jour du logiciel de l'ordinateur XO-1.5. Les 1,5 millions d'enfants qui utilisent déjà Sugar sur le XO-1 d'origine pourront également bénéficier de cette mise à jour, grâce au concours du Paraguay Educa qui a adapté cette mise à jour pour le XO-1.

La plateforme éducative Sugar fait la promotion de l'apprentissage collaboratif à travers des Activités adaptées aux enfants, qui encouragent une pensée critique. L'interface bureautique GNOME, installé sur toutes les distributions majeures GNU/Linux, est destinée aux enfants plus âgés et aux adultes. Changer d'environnement se fait en un clic. Avec l'environnement GNOME présent sur l'ordinateur XO, la porte est ouverte à des millers d'applications éducatives et créatives supplémentaires.

Le XO-1.5 est basé sur le même design que le premier XO. Equipé d'un processeur VIA, il est deux fois plus rapide que la première génération et dispose de quatre fois plus de mémoire RAM et d'espace de stockage. La fondation OLPC a annoncé la disponibilité d'une version destinée aux collégiens du dernier XO-1.5, nommé XO-HS (High School Edition), avec un clavier entièrement revu, plus confortable pour les élèves plus âgés. Le premier déploiement du XO-HS se déroulera en septembre en Uruguay dans le cadre du très réussi Plan Ceibal.

Les enfants habitués au XO-1 pourront évoluer vers un XO-1.5 avec ses fonctionnalités supérieures. "Le projet One Laptop per Child promeut le logiciel libre si bien que l'enfant pourra grandir et adapter son XO à ses besoins. La plateforme Sugar sur le XO est l'élément clé de notre mission éducative car il offre à l'élève un environnement d'apprentissage unique et intuitif", explique Rodrigo Arboleda, président de l'association OLPC.

Stormy Peters, Directeur Exécutif de la fondation GNOME, indique que "Nous sommes vraiment enthousiasmés de travailler avec Sugar et le projet OLPC pour fournir une interface bureautique aux enfants de tous les âges. La mission de GNOME est de fournir une interface bureautique libre et accessible à tous. De l'Uruguay au Ghana, les enfants pourront utiliser leurs nouveaux XO pour apprendre et pour montrer à leurs amis et famille comment utiliser Sugar et GNOME."

Walter Bender, Directeur Exécutif du Sugar Labs, précise que "La fluidité du passage d'un bureau à l'autre offre aux élèves la capacité de passer d'un environnement d'apprentissage - Sugar - à un environnement de production et de productivité - GNOME. Ils ont ainsi les moyens de transformer les compétences créatives qu'ils ont acquis à l'école primaire en des compétences entrepreneuriales dans le cadre de l'enseignement secondaire."

De plus, Sugar on a Stick permet aux enfants qui n'ont pas l'ordinateur XO de bénéficier de ce nouveau logiciel. Il est téléchargeable sur le site web du Sugar Labs dans sa nouvelle version, v3 "Mirabelle". Il peut être chargé sur n'importe quelle clé USB et utilisé pour démarrer un PC sous Sugar, sans modifier le contenu du disque dur. L'ordinateur XO et Sugar on a Stick fonctionnent avec Fedora GNU/Linux.

ASUNCIÓN, June 14, 2010 – Sugar Labs, the GNOME Free Desktop Project, and One Laptop per Child (OLPC) have announced an update to the software offered on the OLPC XO-1.5. The 1.5 million children already using Sugar on the original XO-1 can also benefit from the update, since Paraguay Educa has backported the software.

The Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning through child-friendly Activities that encourage critical thinking. The GNOME free desktop is a hallmark of all major GNU/Linux distributions, suitable for older children and grownups. Switching between the two environments takes only a single click. With GNOME on the XO laptop, the door is opened to thousands of additional educational and productivity applications.

The XO-1.5 has the same industrial design as the original XO-1. Based on a VIA processor, it provides 2× the speed of the XO-1, 4× DRAM memory, and 4× FLASH memory. OLPC has announced the availability of a high-school edition of the XO-1.5, the XO-HS, with a newly designed keyboard, more comfortable for older students. The first deployment of the XO-HS is set to begin in Uruguay under the highly successful Plan Ceibal in September.

Children familiar with the XO-1 will naturally grow into the XO-1.5 with its expanded functionality. “One Laptop per Child promotes open-source software so that it can grow and adapt to the needs of the child. The Sugar platform on the XO is key to our educational mission because it gives students a unique and intuitive learning software environment,” said OLPC Association CEO Rodrigo Arboleda.

Stormy Peters, Executive Director of the GNOME Foundation, said, “We're really excited to be working with Sugar and OLPC to provide desktop software to children of all ages. GNOME's mission is to provide a free desktop accessible to everyone. Children from Uruguay to Ghana will be able to use their XOs to learn and to show their friends and families how to use Sugar and GNOME.”

Walter Bender, Executive Director of Sugar Labs, said “the fluidity of movement between the two desktops gives learners the ability to transition from a learning environment – Sugar – to a production and productivity environment – GNOME. They have the means of honing the creative skills acquired in an elementary education setting into entrepreneurial skills in a secondary education setting.”

“Sugar on a Stick” allows children who don't have an XO laptop to benefit from this new software. Available for download from Sugar Labs in the new, v3 Mirabelle flavor, it can be loaded onto an ordinary USB thumbdrive and used to start a PC in Sugar without touching the hard disk. The XO laptops and Sugar on a Stick run Fedora GNU/Linux.

ASUNCIÓN, 14 Giugno, 2010 – Sugar Labs, GNOME Free Desktop Project, e One Laptop per Child (OLPC) annunciano un aggiornamento al software fornito insieme sui OLPC XO-1.5. Anche il milione e mezzo di bambini che già utilizzano Sugar con gli XO-1 originali potranno beneficiare dell'aggiornamento grazie al backporting realizzato da Paraguay Educa.

Sugar Learning Platform promuove l'apprendimento collaborativo attraverso molteplici Attività orientate all'infanzia, studiate anche per stimolare il pensiero critico. Lo GNOME free desktop è il marchio di fabbrica di tutte le principali distribuzioni GNU/Linux ed è ottimo per i bimbi più grandi e gli adolescenti. Per alternare i due ambienti operativi è sufficiente un singolo click. Con GNOME sui laptop XO si apre la porta a migliaia di altri applicativi per la didattica e per la produttività.

Il laptop XO-1.5 ha design identico all'XO-1 originale. Essendo basato su processore VIA, ha il doppio della velocità, il quadruplo della memoria RAM ed il quadruplo della memoria FLASH rispetto a un XO-1. OLPC ha annunciato la disponibilità di una versione specifica per le scuole superiori dell'XO-1.5, che sarà chiamata XO-HS, dotata di una tastiera riprogettata per essere più funzionale per gli studenti più grandi. La prima consegna di XO-HS è prevista in settembre in Uruguay nel contesto del progetto di successo Plan Ceibal.

I bambini che hanno già familiarità con XO-1 potranno crescere con le maggiori funzionalità di XO-1.5. “One Laptop per Child" promuove il software libero così che possa crescere, migliorare ed adattarsi alle esigenze dei bambini. La Piattaforma Sugar su XO è un componente chiave per la nostra missione educativa, in quanto offre agli studenti un ambiente software di lavoro uniforme e intuitivo", dichiara Rodrigo Arboleda, CEO della OLPC Association.

Stormy Peters, Direttore Esecutivo della GNOME Foundation, dichiara, “Siamo entusiasti di avere l'opportunità per lavorare con Sugar e OLPC per fornire un software di desktop ai giovani di tutte le età. La missione di GNOME è quella di realizzare un desktop libero utilizzabile da tutti. Bambini dall'Uruguay al Ghana potranno utilizzare i loro laptop XO per apprendere e insegnare ai loro amici e genitori come utilizzare insieme Sugar e GNOME.”

Walter Bender, Direttore Esecutivo di Sugar Labs, dichiara “la fluidità di movimento fra i due ambienti desktop offre agli studenti la possibilità di passare da una piattaforma di apprendimento – Sugar – ad un ambiente di produttività e lavoro – GNOME. Avranno quindi gli strumenti per utilizzare le conoscenze creative acquisite nella loro educazione di base per sviluppare capacità imprenditoriali nella educazione secondaria.”

“Sugar on a Stick” permette ai bambini che non possiedono un laptop XO di beneficiare di questo nuovo software. Disponibile per il download dal sito internet di Sugar Labs nella nuova versione, v3 Mirabelle, può essere caricato su una normale chiavetta USB di memoria ed utilizzata per avviare un PC con Sugar senza modificare in alcun modo il computer ospite. I laptop XO e Sugar on a Stick utilizzano Fedora GNU/Linux.

MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay, Abril 15, 2011 — Sugar Labs (R), el fabricante de software para el proyecto One Laptop Per Child (OLPC), va a patrocinar a Team Chipotle, el equipo de ciclistas de Slipstream Sports LLC en un acuerdo sin precedentes que permitirá recabar fondos para la organización sin fines de lucro. La participación del equipo Chipotle permitirá que se conozca la labor de Sugar Labs a lo largo de todo el mundo: la camiseta del equipo Chipotle Development llevará el logo de Sugar Labs.

"El joven equipo de ciclistas Slipstream Sports ha surgido del objetivo fundacional de la compañía de apoyar los jóvenes talentos y desarrollar la próxima generación de campeones de ciclismo. A los niños les encantan las carreras de bicicletas, y los jóvenes ciclistas son excelentes referentes para los ellos", dijo Jonathan Vaughters, CEO de Slipstream Sports. "Queremos generar un cambio en las vidas de los jóvenes estudiantes y atletas y nuestro innovador acuerdo de patrocinio con Sugar Labas es parte de ello."

El equipo participará durante los próximos 10 días en la 68a. Vuelta Ciclista del Uruguay 2011. Los escolares uruguayos se incorporarán al evento tomando fotos y escribiendo artículos con sus laptops verdes XO cuando la carrera llegue a sus ciudades. Enviarán su trabajo a [concurso@rapceibal.info](mailto:concurso@rapceibal.info) para que se publique en el blog [http://www.sugarlabs.org/vueltaciclista](http://www.sugarlabs.org/vueltaciclista). Los mejores artículos recibirán premios que serán entregados en el próximo evento de desarrolladores de software eduJAM! que tendrá lugar en Montevideo del 5 al 7 de mayo ([http://ceibaljam.org](http://ceibaljam.org)).

"Los deportes y STEM (por ciencia, tecnología, ingeniería y matemáticas en inglés) tienen una gran sinergia. Estamos entusiasmados con las oportunidad de despertar el interés de los niños en matemáticas y ciencia a través de su interés por la carrera", dijo Walter Bender, fundador y director ejecutivo de Sugar Labs.

Uruguay es el primer país en el mundo de equipar al 100% de estudiantes y maestros de escuela primaria, más de medio millón de personas, con una laptop OLPC XO ejecuando Sugar a través del Plan Ceibal ([http://ceibaljam.org](http://ceibaljam.org)).

Según Gabriel Eirea del CeibalJAM!, "Esta carrera, luego del fútbol, es el evento deportivo más popular en nuestro país y es una parte integral de la cultura local. Cada año durante Semana Santa esta carrera recorre muchas localidades remotas del país y es seguida por cientos de miles de entusiastas espectadores. La comunidad de voluntarios que apoya la implementación del Plan Ceibal, representada por RAP Ceibal y ceibalJAM!, desea promover el uso de las laptops XO en las escuelas, en las comunidades y promueve la apropiación de la tecnología. Con la plataforma Sugar y la laptop XO, nuestros niños no solamente consumen contenido, sino que lo generan. Durante la carrera, niños de todo el país bloguearán sobre el equipo. En el evento eduJAM!, desarrolladores de la plataforma Sugar se encontrarán con niños que se beneficiarán de su trabajo y son el centro de su misión."

MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay, April 15, 2011 — Sugar Labs®, software provider to the
One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project, will sponsor Team Chipotle, the
Continental cycling team owned and operated by Slipstream Sports LLC, in a
groundbreaking arrangement which will raise funds to support the nonprofit's
educational mission. Team Chipotle will raise awareness for Sugar Labs at
races around the world with team jerseys carrying the Sugar Labs logo.

"Team Chipotle has grown out of our founding goal of developing the next
generation of cycling champions. Every kid loves a bike race and young
cyclists provide great role models for children," said Jonathan Vaughters, CEO
of Slipstream Sports. "We want to make a difference in the lives of young
athletes and children and our innovative sponsorship arrangement with Sugar
Labs is part of that."

The team will race over the next ten days in the 68th Vuelta Ciclista del
Uruguay 2011 and pupils there will participate, taking photos and writing
articles with their green XO laptops as the race passes through their towns,
and e-mailing them to
[concurso@rapceibal.info](mailto:concurso@rapceibal.info) for posting to a
blog ([http://www.sugarlabs.org/vueltaciclista](http://www.sugarlabs.org/vueltaciclista)). The best articles will win
prizes to be awarded at the eduJAM! Developers Summit which will take place in
Montevideo May 5–7 ([http://ceibaljam.org](http://ceibaljam.org)).

"Sports and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) have a
great synergy. We are excited by the prospect of engaging children in learning
math and science through their excitement about the race", said Walter Bender,
founder and Executive Director of Sugar Labs.

Uruguay is the first country in the world to provide 100% of its elementary
school pupils and teachers - over half a million - with an OLPC XO laptop
running Sugar through its Plan Ceibal ([http://ceibaljam.org](http://ceibaljam.org)).

According to Gabriel Eirea of CeibalJAM!, "This race is, after football, the
most popular sports event in the country and is an integral part of our local
culture. Every year during Holy Week this race passes through the remotest
towns of the country and is followed by hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic
viewers. The volunteer community supporting Plan Ceibal, represented by RAP
Ceibal and ceibalJAM!, wants to promote the use of XO laptops beyond the
schools, inside the communities, advocating technology appropriation. With
Sugar and the XO, our children don't just consume content, they create it.
During the race, children throughout the country will be blogging about the
team. At eduJAM!, Sugar Labs developers will meet children who are at the
center of their mission and benefit from their work."

CAMBRIDGE, Mass, 5 de Febrero del 2013 – Sugar Labs(R), una organización educativa sin fines de lucro, proveedora de software libre para el aprendizaje para niños, se enorgullece de celebrar el 6 de febrero como el Día del Aprendizaje Digital.  
**Enlace:** [Digital Learning Day](http://www.digitallearningday.org)

...con dos ganadores del principal premio del Google Code-In, Agustin Zubiaga Sanchez y Aneesh Dogra, quienes tuvieron una brillante participación en el programa anual de Google, para estudiantes de entre 13 y 17 años de edad. Más de 50 participantes de 14 países participaron para mejorar Sugar, guiados por 22 voluntarios de Sugar Labs(R). Los ganadores visitarán las instalaciones de Google en Mountain View, CA, esta primavera.  
**Más info:** [Google Code-In 2012](http://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/2012)

Agustin (Aguz para sus amigos) tiene 15 años, vive en un pueblo de Uruguay y es un reciente graduado de la escuela técnica Rafael Perazza dependiente de la Universidad del Trabajo del Uruguay. Luego de usar Sugar por varios años, su maestro del club de computadoras lo animó a aprender el lenguaje de programación Python usado en Sugar. Uno de sus proyectos involucra código para agregar una imagen de fondo a la Vista de Hogar de Sugar. Él dice: "Comencé a programar gracias a Sugar y ahora estoy muy contento de ser uno de sus desarrolladores."

Aneesh, quien ya ganó el Google Code-In del año anterior, tiene 17 años y vive en Punjab, India. Él trabajó actualizando un gran número de Actividades Sugar para niños y contribuyó con el libro electrónico "Cómo hacer una Actividad Sugar".

**Premio anterior:** [Raspberry Pi Summer Coding](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/2544)  
**Blog personal de Aneesh:** [anee.me](http://anee.me)

"Fue muy difícil elegir los ganadores," comentó Chris Leonard, enlace por Sugar Labs(R) para el Google Code-In. "Un tercio de nuestros participantes completó múltiples tareas. Aneesh fue muy prolífico, completando más de 40 tareas y Aguz hizo mejoras fundamentales en la plataforma Sugar. Todos nuestros participantes aprendieron cosas en estos tres meses. Notablemente, un participante, Daniel Francis, de Uruguay, tuvo que retirarse del concurso porque fue elegido para la Comisión de Supervisión de Sugar Labs, durante el concurso, a la madura edad de 14 años."

"Seis años después de que Sugar apareció en las aulas, su primera generación de estudiantes está convirtiéndose en los ingenieros, escritores y maestros del mañana," dice Walter Bender, fundador de Sugar Labs. "Aguz y Daniel crecieron con Sugar en Uruguay donde es usado en cada escuela, y Google Code-In tuvo su primer participante desde Perú, donde Sugar es parte de un programa nacional también. Sugar fue diseñado para tener un piso bajo, sin techo, y su Diario, Actividades, colaboración integrada y Visualización de código lo hacen ideal para el aula."

Aunque Sugar es usado principalmente en países en desarrollo mundialmente a través del programa One Laptop Per Child, apela a que todos los niños descubran la era digital del siglo 21.  
**Conoce más:** [One Laptop Per Child](http://laptop.org)

El Dr. Gerald Ardito, un miembro del comité para Sugar Labs(R), maestro de escuela media y profesor de Ciencias de la Computación en Westchester, NY, ha usado las Laptops XO y Sugar en una variedad de contextos educacionales. "Lo que ha sido tan poderoso es ver a los estudiantes ser capaces de tomar posesión real de su aprendizaje cuando usan Sugar", él dice. "Los he visto una y otra vez, pasar de ser consumidores a ser productores de medios digitales."

Sugar Labs(R) desea agradecer a Google y a Bradley Kuhn de la organización Software Freedom Conservancy, madre de Sugar Labs y otros proyectos de software libre/código abierto.

Cambridge (Massachusetts), 5 février 2013 — Le Sugar Labs(R), l'éditeur éducatif à but non lucratif de logiciels libres et ouverts à destination des enfants, a le plaisir de célébrer la Journée d'Apprentissage Numérique (Digital Learning Day) du 6 février.  
**Lien :** [Digital Learning Day](http://www.digitallearningday.org)

Avec les lauréats au grand prix Google Code-In :  
**Lien :** [Google Code-In 2012](http://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/2012)  
Agustin Zubiaga Sanchez et Aneesh Dogra, deux participants brillants au programme annuel de Google destiné aux élèves de l'enseignement secondaire, âgés de 13 à 17 ans. Plus de 50 participants représentant 14 pays, accompagnés par 22 tuteurs volontaires pour le Sugar Labs, ont contribué à améliorer Sugar. Les lauréats visiteront le siège de Google à Mountain View, en Californie, au cours du printemps prochain. Google Code-In et son programme associé destiné aux étudiants de niveau universitaire, le Google Summer of Code, invitent les organismes open source à encadrer des étudiants travaillant sur des tâches de programmation et de documentation réelles.

Agustin (Aguz pour ses amis) est âgé de 15 ans. Il vit dans un village en Uruguay et vient d'obtenir son diplôme universitaire du centre Rafael Perazza de l'Universidad del Trabajo del Uruguay (UTU). Utilisateur de Sugar depuis plusieurs années, son enseignant du club informatique l'a encouragé à apprendre le langage de programmation Python utilisé par Sugar. L'un de ses projets consistait à ajouter des images d'arrière-plan à la page d'accueil de Sugar. Il déclare : "C'est grâce à Sugar que j'ai commencé à programmer. Aujourd'hui, je suis très heureux d'être l'un de ses développeurs."

Aneesh, lui aussi lauréat du Google Code-In de l'an passé, a 17 ans et vit au Punjab, en Inde. Il a participé à la mise à jour de plusieurs "apps" Sugar destinées aux enfants et a contribué à la rédaction du livre électronique :  
**Lien :** [Réalisez votre propre activité Sugar](http://www.flossmanuals.net/make-your-own-sugar-activities)

Après avoir gagné différents prix, parmi lesquels :  
**Lien :** [Raspberry Pi Summer Coding Contest](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/2544),  
il s'intéresse aux applications audiovisuelles et à la sécurité informatique. Aneesh publie son blog :  
**Lien :** [anee.me](http://anee.me)

"Choisir les lauréats n'était pas une tâche facile", explique Chris Leonard, le correspondant du Sugar Labs auprès du Google Code-In. "Un bon tiers de nos participants ont réalisé différentes tâches. Aneesh a eu une activité prolifique, avec plus de 40 tâches à son actif, et Aguz a apporté des améliorations capitales à la plateforme Sugar. Tous nos participants ont beaucoup appris au cours de ces trois derniers mois. Fait remarquable, l'un des participants, Daniel Francis, d'Uruguay, a dû se retirer du concours après avoir été désigné au Sugar Labs Oversight Board pendant le déroulement du concours. Détail important : il vient tout juste d'avoir 14 ans."

"Six ans après la première utilisation de Sugar dans des salles de classe, cette première génération d'étudiants préfigure les ingénieurs, les auteurs et les enseignants de demain," a déclaré Walter Bender, le fondateur du Sugar Labs. "Aguz et Daniel ont grandi avec Sugar, en Uruguay, alors que Sugar est utilisé dans toutes les écoles et que le Google Code-In compte son tout premier participant originaire du Pérou, pays dans lequel Sugar intègre également le cursus scolaire national. Sugar a été conçu pour sa facilité d'accès et son potentiel illimité. Le 'Journal', les 'Activités', les fonctions de collaboration et de visualisation du code source, qui intègrent la plateforme Sugar, en font un instrument idéal pour la classe."

Sugar est utilisé dans de nombreux pays émergents dans le monde entier, participant au programme :  
**Lien :** [One Laptop Per Child](http://laptop.org)  
Il s'adresse, plus largement, à tous les enfants qui découvrent le 21ème siècle numérique.

Gerald Ardito, membre du bureau du Sugar Labs, enseignant de collège et professeur d'informatique à Westchester (New-York), utilise Sugar dans différents contextes éducatifs. De son propre aveu, "Observer les étudiants prendre littéralement en mains leur propre apprentissage grâce à Sugar est une expérience unique". "J'ai observé à de nombreuses reprises, au cours de ces dernières années, comment ils passaient du stade de consommateurs de médias numériques à celui de producteurs."

Le Sugar Labs tient à exprimer sa gratitude à Google et tout particulièrement à Bradley Kuhn, le directeur exécutif du Software Freedom Conservancy, organisme fédérant le Sugar Labs et 27 autres projets de logiciels libres et ouverts.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass, February 5, 2013 — Sugar Labs(R), educational nonprofit provider of free and open-source learning software for children, is proud to celebrate **[Digital Learning Day](http://www.digitallearningday.org)** on February 6th with **[Google Code-In](http://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/2012)** grand prize winners Agustin Zubiaga Sanchez and Aneesh Dogra, who participated brilliantly in Google's annual program for middle and high school students aged 13 to 17. Over 50 participants from 14 countries, mentored by 22 Sugar Labs volunteers, helped to improve Sugar. The winners will visit Google headquarters in Mountain View, CA this spring. Google Code-In and its sister program for university students, Google Summer of Code, invite open source organizations to mentor students who work on real programming and documentation tasks.

Agustin (Aguz to his friends) is 15, lives in a village in Uruguay and is a recent graduate of Rafael Perazza Technical High School at Universidad del Trabajo del Uruguay. After using Sugar for several years, his computer club teacher encouraged him to learn the Python programming language used in Sugar. One of his projects involved code to add background images to Sugar's Home View. He says, "I started programming thanks to Sugar and now I am very happy to be one of its developers."

Aneesh, also a winner at last year's Google Code-In, is 17 and lives in Punjab, India. He worked on updating a large number of Sugar "Apps" for children and contributed to the "**[Make Your Own Sugar Activities!](http://www.flossmanuals.net/make-your-own-sugar-activities)**" ebook. Having won previous honors, including runner-up in last year's **[Raspberry Pi Summer Coding Contest](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/2544)**, he is interested in audiovisual applications and computer security. More information about Aneesh is available on his **[blog](http://anee.me)**.

"We had a hard time choosing our winners," commented Chris Leonard, Sugar Labs liaison for Google Code-In. "Fully a third of our participants completed multiple tasks. Aneesh was prolific, completing over 40 tasks, and Aguz made fundamental improvements to the Sugar platform itself. All of our participants learned over these past three months. Notably, one participant, Daniel Francis of Uruguay, had to take his name out the running because he was elected to the Sugar Labs Oversight Board during the contest at the ripe old age of 14."

"Six years after Sugar first appeared in classrooms, its first generation of learners are becoming tomorrow's engineers, writers, and teachers," said Walter Bender, founder of Sugar Labs. "Aguz and Daniel grew up with Sugar in Uruguay where Sugar is used in every school and Google Code-In had its first ever participant from Peru, where Sugar is part of the nationwide curriculum as well. Sugar was designed to be low floor, no ceiling and its Journal, Activities, built-in collaboration and View Source features make Sugar ideal for the classroom."

Sugar is used in developing countries worldwide through the **[One Laptop Per Child program](http://laptop.org)**, but it also appeals to all children discovering the digital 21st century. Dr. Gerald Ardito, a Sugar Labs board member, as well as a middle school teacher and professor of Computer Science in Westchester, NY, has used Sugar in a variety of educational settings. "It is so powerful to watch students be able to take real ownership of their learning when they are using Sugar", he said. "I have seen them time and time again move from being consumers of computer centered media to producers."

Sugar Labs wishes to thank Google and in particular Bradley Kuhn, executive director of the Software Freedom Conservancy, parent organization of Sugar Labs and 27 other free/libre software projects.

CAACUPÉ, Paraguay, October 12, 2013 — Sugar Labs®, educational nonprofit provider of free and open-source learning software for children, is proud to celebrate **TurtleArt Day**  
- **Event Info:** [TurtleArt Day](http://turtleartday.org)  
in Caacupé, Paraguay, with 275 students, their parents, and 77 teachers. They were joined by educators and Sugar developers from 8 countries throughout the Americas and as far away as Australia. Additional TurtleArt Days are planned for Peru, Costa Rica, Argentina, and Malaysia; the next will be October 15th in Montevideo, Uruguay.

Caacupé has been the focus of a one-to-one learning program run by  
- **Organization:** [Paraguay Educa](http://www.paraguayeduca.org)  
since 2008. The foundation is active in 35 schools, working with 365 teachers and 9,700 children. The children of Caacupé live in areas with high poverty levels: 60% of them are street workers and most have at least one parent living abroad. Much of the coordination was done by "Evolution" children, youth leaders in Caacupé who attend school in the morning, teach in the afternoon, and on weekends supply technical support to school programs.

TurtleArt is a programming environment with a graphical "turtle" that draws colorful art based on snap-together elements. Its "low floor" provides an easy entry point for beginners. It also has "high ceiling" programming features that challenge the more adventurous student. TurtleArt's roots are in Logo, the first programming language for children, created by Seymour Papert, Wally Feurzeig, Daniel Bobrow, and Cynthia Solomon in 1967. Logo's friendly turtle, which relies on instructions from children to move, has inspired adaptations from Logo for the Apple® II to Lego® Mindstorms®, TurtleArt, and Scratch.

An international group of TurtleArtists travelled to Caacupé with the generous support of BBVA Bank to launch the first TurtleArt Day. Also participating was  
- **EduJam Group:** [EduJam!](http://ceibaljam.org)  
attendants, a group of developers who work on open-source educational software. Caacupé's participants enjoyed workshops to create TurtleArt projects; interactive programming that involved robots and sensors; and discussions where educators and children shared their experiences.

> "Logo was designed to be 'mathland'; TurtleArt is 'artland'," says Artemis Papert, co-creator of TurtleArt.  
> "It allows us to bring together art and programming. While you do art, you also do programming, math, and geometry — the tools you need while focusing on doing art. We have observed that artists become more comfortable with programming and programmers become more comfortable with art when they use TurtleArt."

Cecilia Rodríguez Alcalá, Executive Director of Paraguay Educa, said,  
> "The aspects of TurtleArt Day highlighted by the Evolution team included cultural exchange between the children and the international community, and children teaching each other, pursuing their personal interests, including projects involving physical-world interaction."

Claudia Urrea, an educator and member of the Sugar Labs Oversight Board, said,  
> "With TurtleArt, the children enjoyed programming the robots and using sensors, creating artistic images, engaging in the concrete use of mathematical concepts such as variables and random numbers, realizing how quickly the pace of their learning evolved, and discovering the multiple applicabilities of computation."

Andres Aguirre of the Butia project, a robot programmed with TurtleArt, said,  
> "Even though the children had limited time to use the robots, they were able to experiment with some high-level programming concepts such as conditionals and control structures."

Caacupé, Paraguay, 12 de octubre de 2013 — Sugar Labs®, el proveedor educativo de aprendizaje sin fines de lucro de software libre y de código abierto para los niños, se enorgullece de celebrar el Día de Tortugarte en Caacupé, Paraguay, con 275 estudiantes, sus padres y 77 profesores. A ellos se sumaron educadores y desarrolladores de Sugar procedentes de 8 países de América y de otros lugares lejanos como Australia. Están previstos Días de Tortugarte adicionales para Perú, Costa Rica, Argentina y Malasia; el próximo será el 15 de octubre en Montevideo, Uruguay.

Caacupé ha sido objeto del programa Una Computadora Por Niño —modelo de aprendizaje uno a uno— a cargo de Paraguay Educa desde 2008. La fundación opera en 35 escuelas, en colaboración con 365 profesores y 9.700 niños. Los niños y niñas de Caacupé viven en áreas con altos niveles de pobreza: el 60 % de ellos trabaja en la calle y la mayoría tiene al menos un padre que vive en el extranjero. Gran parte de la coordinación fue hecha por los chicos "Evolution", líderes juveniles de Caacupé que asisten a la escuela por la mañana, enseñan por la tarde y los fines de semana ofrecen asistencia técnica a los programas escolares.

Tortugarte es un entorno de programación con una "tortuga" gráfica que dibuja arte colorido a base de elementos de cierre conjunto. Su "piso bajo" proporciona un punto de entrada fácil para los principiantes. También cuenta con funciones de programación de "alto techo" que retan al estudiante más aventurero. Las raíces de Tortugarte están en Logo, el primer lenguaje de programación para niños, creado por Seymour Papert, Wally Feurzeig, Daniel Bobrow y Cynthia Salomón en 1967. La tortuga amistosa del logotipo, que se basa en las instrucciones de los niños para moverse, ha inspirado adaptaciones de Logo para Apple® II, Lego® Mindstorms®, Tortugarte y Scratch.

Un grupo internacional de Tortu-artistas viajó a Caacupé con el generoso apoyo del banco BBVA para lanzar el primer Día de Tortugarte. También participaron del eduJAM!, un evento de desarrolladores que trabajan en software educativo de código abierto. Los participantes disfrutaron de talleres para crear proyectos de Tortugarte en Caacupé, programación interactiva con robots y sensores, y discusiones donde educadores y niños compartieron sus experiencias.

"El logotipo fue diseñado para ser 'La Tierra de las Matemáticas'; Tortugarte es 'La Tierra del Arte'", dice Artemis Papert, co-creadora de Tortugarte. "Nos permite reunir el arte y la programación. Mientras uno hace arte, también hace programación, matemáticas y geometría —las herramientas que se necesitan mientras se centra en hacer arte. Hemos observado que los artistas se sienten más cómodos con la programación y los programadores se sienten más cómodos con el arte cuando utilizan Tortugarte."

Brian Silverman, co-creador de Tortugarte, observó: "Me quedé sorprendido por la pasión de los niños que vinieron al Día de Tortugarte: fueron salvajemente entusiastas y mantuvieron su atención durante seis horas. Llegaron al evento con solo una experiencia rudimentaria en Tortugarte y se fueron con más conocimiento acerca de su potencial artístico".

Cecilia Rodríguez Alcalá, directora ejecutiva de Paraguay Educa, dijo: "Entre los aspectos destacados del Día de Tortugarte sobresale el desempeño en equipo de los jóvenes Evolution, ya que incluye el intercambio cultural entre los niños y la comunidad internacional, así como la enseñanza entre pares y proyectos de interacción física en el mundo".

Claudia Urrea, educadora y miembro de la Junta de Supervisión de Sugar Labs, dijo: "Con Tortugarte, los niños disfrutaron de la programación de robots y el uso de sensores, la creación de imágenes artísticas, y la participación concreta en el uso de conceptos matemáticos como variables y números aleatorios. Fue notable la rapidez con que evolucionó su aprendizaje y el descubrimiento de las múltiples aplicaciones de la informática".

Andrés Aguirre, del proyecto Butiá —un robot programado con Tortugarte—, dijo: "A pesar de que había tiempo limitado para usar los robots, los niños fueron capaces de experimentar con algunos conceptos de programación de alto nivel, tales como condicionales y estructuras de control".

CAACUPÉ, Paraguay, le 12 Octobre 2013. Sugar Labs(R), fournisseur à but non lucratif de programmes éducatifs gratuits et sous licence libre, célèbre avec une grande fierté la journée TurtleArt à Caacupé, au Paraguay. 275 élèves y participent avec leurs parents ainsi que 77 professeurs. Des éducateurs et des développeurs Sugar se sont joints à eux, venant de 8 pays des Amériques mais aussi d'aussi loin que l'Australie. De nouvelles journées TurtleArt sont prévues au Pérou, au Costa Rica, en Argentine et en Malaysie; la prochaine aura lieu le 15 octobre à Montevideo, Uruguay.

Caacupé héberge depuis 2008 un programme d'"apprentissage un-à-un" mené par [Paraguay Educa](http://www.paraguayeduca.org). Cette fondation est présente dans 35 écoles, collabore avec 365 professeurs et 9.700 enfants. Les enfants de Caacupé vivent dans des zones de grande pauvreté: 60% d'entre eux sont des travailleurs des rues et la plupart ont au moins un de leur parents qui vit à l'étranger. Une bonne part de la coordination a été assurée par des jeunes de Caacupé, engagés dans le programme "Evolution". Ils suivent les cours à l'école le matin, enseignent l'après-midi et fournissent une assistance technique aux programmes de l'école le week-end.

TurtleArt est un environnement de programmation au sein duquel une "tortue" graphique trace des dessins colorés à partir d'éléments de base pouvant s'emboîter. Son caractère accessible fait d'elle l'activité idéale pour une initiation à la programmation. TurtleArt trouve ses origines dans le langage Logo, le premier langage de programmation pour enfants créé par Seymour Papert, Wally Feurzeig, Daniel Bobrow et Cynthia Solomon en 1967. La sympathique tortue de Logo, qui se déplace suivant les instructions données par les enfants, a inspiré des adaptations allant de l'Apple(R) II à Lego(R) Mindstorms(R), TurtleArt et Scratch.

Un groupe international d'artistes TurtleArt a fait le voyage jusqu'à Caacupé pour ce lancement de la première journée TurtleArt, grâce au généreux soutien financier de la banque BBVA. Parmi les participants à cette première journée on trouve aussi des développeurs de [EduJam!](http://ceibaljam.org), groupe qui développe des logiciels éducatifs en licence libre.

Les participants de Caacupé ont pris part avec enthousiasme à des ateliers autour de projets TurtleArt; de la programmation interactive utilisant des robots et des capteurs et enfin de discussions où éducateurs et enfants ont pu partager leurs expériences.

"Le langage Logo a été conçu comme le 'royaume des maths'; TurtleArt est plutôt le 'royaume du dessin d'art'" nous confie Artemis Papert, co-créateur de TurtleArt. "Il nous offre la possibilité de réunir dessin et programmation. Quand vous pratiquez le dessin, vous faites aussi de la programmation, des maths et de la géométrie – vous vous en servez comme outil pour dessiner. Nous avons remarqué que les artistes se sentent ensuite plus à l'aise en programmation et les programmeurs plus à l'aise dans les activités artistiques quand ils utilisent TurtleArt."

Brian Silverman, co-créateur de TurtleArt fait la remarque suivante: "J'ai été fasciné par la passion éveillée chez les enfants venant participer à la journée TurtleArt. Ils étaient enthousiastes en diable et sont restés concentrés pendant six heures. Ils sont venus ici avec une expérience de TurtleArt vraiment rudimentaire et sont repartis avec une meilleure compréhension de son potentiel artistique."

Cecilia Rodríguez Alcalá, directrice de Paraguay Educa, déclare: "Ce que l'équipe Evolution a mis en lumière lors de cette journée TurtleArt, ce sont les aspects d'échange culturel entre les enfants et la communauté internationale et le fait que les enfants enseignent les uns aux autres, tout en suivant leurs goûts personnels, notamment sur des projets qui comportent une interaction avec le monde physique."

Claudia Urrea, éducatrice et membre du bureau de supervision de Sugar Labs s'entousiasme : "Avec TurtleArt, les enfants adorent programmer les robots et utiliser les capteurs pour créer des images artistiques, s'adonner à des activités concrètes utilisant des concepts mathématiques tels que les variables et les nombres aléatoires. Ils se rendent compte de la vitesse à laquelle ils apprennent et découvrent les applications multiples de l'informatique."

Andres Aguirre du projet Butia, un robot programmé avec TurtleArt, déclare: "Bien que les enfants aient disposé d'un temps limité pour utiliser les robots, ils ont pu faire l'expérience de concepts de programmation haut-niveau tels que les tests conditionnels et structures de contrôle."

CAMBRIDGE, Mass, Enero 22, 2014 — Sugar Labs(R), organización educativa sin fines de lucro que provee software de aprendizaje libre y de código abierto para niños, se enorgullece en reconocer a los ganadores del gran premio de Google Code-In (GCI) Ignacio Rodríguez y Jorge Alberto Gómez López, quienes participaron de forma brillante en el programa anual de Google para estudiantes de secundaria y bachillerato entre 13 a 17 años de edad.

A través de GCI, Google invita a las organizaciones de código abierto a asesorar estudiantes que trabajan en tareas reales de programación y documentación. Poco más de 30 participantes de más de una docena de países —desde Australia a Zimbabwe—, asesorados por voluntarios de Sugar Labs, ayudaron a mejorar la plataforma de aprendizaje Sugar que utilizan más de tres millones de niños en todo el mundo. Los ganadores visitarán la sede de Google en Mountain View, California esta primavera.

Ignácio, quien tiene 14 años y vive en Canelones, Uruguay, creció con Sugar y comenzó a participar en el desarrollo de Sugar desde hace tres años. "¡La competencia fue un lugar para socializar y hacer amigos!", dice él. "Aunque sentí presión, la comunidad estaba allí para ayudar."

Jorge, de 17 años, vive en Santa Tecla, El Salvador. "Nunca en mi vida soñé empezar a trabajar en un proyecto de código abierto; fue muy divertido explorar un mundo totalmente nuevo, aprender nuevas herramientas, y lo más importante, hacer nuevos amigos de diferentes partes del mundo —personas que comparten el mismo objetivo y trabajan como una comunidad. Siento que soy parte de Sugar Labs, que formó parte de un gran proyecto, con los amigos y mentores".

Completan la lista de finalistas de Sugar Labs: Sai Vineet de Jamshedpur, India; Emil Dudev desde Sofía, Bulgaria; y Sam Parkinson desde Canberra, Australia (la plataforma Sugar se utiliza ampliamente en las escuelas australianas). Sam comentó: "Contribuir a Sugar, además de darme experiencia en programación, me ha mostrado cómo la programación colaborativa puede ser divertida. ¡Y también ha sido divertido trabajar hacia una meta significativa común!"

"GCI ha hecho evidente que los usuarios de Sugar se están convirtiendo en los desarrolladores de Sugar: Sugar no sólo les da la licencia, sino también los medios para desarrollar sus propias herramientas de aprendizaje. Al tomar posesión, se convierten en responsables," dijo Walter Bender, fundador de Sugar Labs. "Ha sido difícil elegir a los ganadores. Muchos participantes completaron múltiples tareas. Ignacio fue prolífico, completando más de 60 tareas, pero nuestros cinco finalistas realizaron mejoras fundamentales a la plataforma misma de Sugar."

José Miguel García, un pedagogo del Departamento de Tecnología Educativa de CODICEN-ANEP en Montevideo, observó: "Por segundo año consecutivo, un joven de Uruguay ha ganado la competencia. La implementación del Plan Ceibal, que entrega en propiedad una computadora portátil por niño y adolescente en Uruguay permite alcanzar niveles de equidad en cuanto al acceso a las tecnologías. Estas computadoras portátiles, además de ser utilizadas en la educación formal, permiten a los jóvenes investigar y desarrollarse en diversas actividades, ya sean lúdicas, artísticas, comunicativas, de programación, etc. Estos jóvenes, orientados e incentivados por su familia, profesores y/o por la propia comunidad de Sugar, alcanzan niveles importantes en el desarrollo del conocimiento, habilidad fundamental para la sociedad del siglo XXI."

Sugar Labs desea agradecer a Google y, en particular, a Bradley Kuhn, director ejecutivo de la Software Freedom Conservancy.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass, January 22, 2014 — Sugar Labs®️, educational nonprofit provider of free and open-source learning software for children, is proud to recognize the **Google Code-In Contest**.

**Watch Live:** [Google Code-In Overview](http://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/)  
**Platform:** [Google Open Source Blog](http://google-opensource.blogspot.fr/2014/01/google-code-in-2013-drumroll-please.html)

Grand-prize winners **Ignacio Rodríguez** and **Jorge Alberto Gómez López**, who participated brilliantly in Google's annual program for middle- and high-school students aged 13 to 17. Through GCI, Google invites open source organizations to mentor students who work on real programming and documentation tasks. Over 30 participants from more than a dozen countries — from Australia to Zimbabwe — mentored by Sugar Labs volunteers, helped to improve the Sugar Learning Platform used by over three million children worldwide. The winners will visit Google headquarters in Mountain View, California this spring.

Ignacio, who is 14 and lives in Canelones, Uruguay, grew up with Sugar and began participating in Sugar development three years ago. "The competition was a place to socialize and make friends!", he says. "While I felt pressure, the community was there to help."

Jorge, age 17, lives in Santa Tecla, El Salvador. "I never dreamed I would be working on an open source project; it was really fun to explore a whole new world, learn new tools, and most importantly, make new friends from different parts of the world — people that share the same objective and work as a community. I feel that I'm part of Sugar Labs, part of a big project, with friends and mentors."

Rounding out the Sugar Labs list of finalists are **Sai Vineet** from Jamshedpur, India, **Emil Dudev** from Sofia, Bulgaria, and **Sam Parkinson** from Canberra, Australia (Sugar is widely deployed in Australian schools). Sam remarked, "Contributing to Sugar has, besides giving me experience in programming, shown me how fun programming collaboratively can be! And it's also been fun working towards a common, meaningful goal."

> "GCI has made it evident that Sugar users are becoming the Sugar developers: Sugar not only gives them the license but also the means for developing their own tools for learning. In taking ownership, they become responsible,"  
> — *Walter Bender, founder of Sugar Labs*

"We had a difficult time choosing our winners. Many participants completed multiple tasks. Ignacio was prolific, completing over 60 tasks, but all five of our finalists made fundamental improvements to the Sugar platform itself."

**José Miguel García**, an education researcher from the Department of Educational Technology at Uruguay's CODICEN-ANEP in Montevideo, observed:

> "For the second consecutive year a youth from Uruguay has won the competition. The nationwide Plan Ceibal, which delivers a laptop running Sugar to every child, achieves levels of equity in access to technology. These laptops, besides being used in formal education, enable young people to explore and develop activities, whether recreational, artistic, communication, programming, etc. These young people, guided and encouraged by their families, teachers, and the Sugar community are reaching significant levels in the development of 21st century skills."

Sugar Labs wishes to thank Google and in particular **Bradley Kuhn**, executive director of the Software Freedom Conservancy.

Story1: The connection between Sugar - Students - Teachers
---------------------------------------------------------
* * *

One of the first formal studies of Sugar took place in Uruguay in 2009–10. Uruguay was the first country to provide every child a free internet-connected laptop computer. They began distributing OLPC XO laptops running Sugar in 2007. Even though Uruguay is a relatively small country, with less than 500,000 children, it took several years before they could achieve full coverage. The last region to receive laptops was Montevideo. Montevideo was last because there was less need there than in the more rural regions, since many urban children already had access to computers. The delay in deploying in Montevideo presented an opportunity to study the impact of Sugar. Children were asked in 2009—before they has Sugar—what they did with their computers. It should come as no surprise that they used their computers to play games (See Figure). The same children were asked in 2010—after almost one year of using Sugar—what they did with their computers. Again they responded that they used their computers to play games. They were still children after all. But they also used their computers to write, chat, paint, make and watch videos, search for information, etc. In other words, with Sugar, they used the computer as a tool. Children play games. But given the opportunity and the correct affordances, they can leverage computation to do much much more.

**Figure: Data from a DSPE-ANEP survey of students in Montevideo before and after the deployment of Sugar**

Sugar was designed so that new uses emerging from the community could easily be incorporated, thus Sugar could be augmented and amplified by its community and the end users. We encouraged our end users to make contributions to the software itself. This was in part out of necessity: we were a small team with limited resources and we had no direct access to local curricula, needs, or problems. But our ulterior motive was to engage our users in development as a vehicle for their own learning.

One of the first examples of end-user contributions took place in Abuja, Nigeria, site of the first OLPC pilot project. While teachers and students took to Sugar quickly, they did confront some problems. The most notable of these was that the word-processor application, Write, did not have a spelling dictionary in Igbo, the dialect used in this particular classroom (and one of the more than three-hundred languages currently spoken in Nigeria). From a conventional software-development standpoint, solving this problem (300 times) would be prohibitively expensive. But for children in Abuja, equipped with Sugar, the solution was simple: confronted with the problem of lacking a dictionary, they made their own Igbo dictionary. The did not look for others to do the work for them. The took on the responsibility themselves. The Free/Libre Software ethic built into Sugar enabled local control and innovation.

John Gilmore heard the about our aspiration to reach out to our end users—children—at the 2008 Libreplanet conference. He asked, "how many patches have you received from kids?" At the time, the answer to his question was zero. But over the past nine years, the situation has changed dramatically. By 2015, 50% of the patches in our new releases were coming from children (See Table); our release manager in 2015–16 (Sugar v0.108) was Sam Parkinson, a fifteen-year-old from Australia; our current release manager (Sugar v0.110) is Ignacio Rodríguez, an eighteen-year-old from Uruguay who began hanging out on our IRC channel at age ten and contributing code at age twelve.

**Table 1: Sugar commits by youth contributors**

When the now former president of Uruguay, José Mujica, learned that a twelve-year-old from a small town east of Montevideo had programmed six entirely new Sugar activities for the XO, he smiled and said triumphantly: "Now we have hackers." In his eyes, this one child's ability to contribute to the global Sugar development community was a leading indicator of change and development in his country.

None of this happened on its own. End-user contributions are not simply an artifact of Sugar been Free/Libre Software. Open-source Software gives you access to the code and that Free/Libre Software gives you a license to make changes. But without some level of support, very few people will have the means to exercise the rights granted to them under the license. For this reason, we built scaffolding into Sugar to directly support making changes and extensions to Sugar applications and Sugar itself.

Sugar has no black boxes: the learner sees what the software does and how it does it. Sugar is written in Python and comes with all of the tools necessary to modify Sugar applications and Sugar itself. We chose Python as our development language because of its transparency and clarity. It is a very approachable language for inexperienced programmers. With just one keystroke or mouse click, the Sugar "view source" feature allows the user to look at any program they are running. A second mouse click results in a copy of the application being saved to the Sugar Applications directory, where it is immediately available for modification. (We use a "copy on write" scheme in order to reduce the risk of breaking critical tools. If there is no penalty for breaking code, there is better risk-reward ratio for exploring and modifying code.) The premise is that taking something apart and reassembling it in different ways is a key to understanding it.

Not every creative use of Sugar involves programming. Rosamel Norma Ramírez Méndez is a teacher from a school in Durazno, a farming region about two-hours drive north from Montevideo, Uruguay. Ramírez had her lessons for the week prepared when, first thing Monday morning, one of her students walked into her classroom holding a loofa. The child asked Ramírez, "teacher, what is this?" Rather than answering the question, Ramírez seized the opportunity to engage her class in an authentic learning experience. She discarded her lesson plans for the week. Instead, on Monday the children figured out what they had found; on Tuesday they determined that they could grow it in their community; on Wednesday they investigated whether or not they should grow it in their community; on Thursday they prepared a presentation to give to their farmer parents on Friday about why they should grow this potential cash crop. Not every teacher has the insight into learning demonstrated by Ramírez. And not every teacher has the courage to discard their lesson plans in order to capture a learning opportunity, But given an extraordinary teacher, she was able to mentor her students as they used Sugar as a tool for problem-solving. Ramírez encouraged her students to become active in their learning, which means that they engaged in doing, making, problem-solving, and reflection.

_**"Teachers can learn (and contribute) too." – Walter Bender**_

Sometimes teachers have been directly involved in Sugar software development. Sugar has an abacus application to help children explore whole-number arithmetic and the concept base (the activity allows the user to switch between various base representations of whole numbers). It also lets children design their own abacus. Teachers in Caacupé, Paraguay, were searching for a way to help their students with the concept of fractions. After playing with the Sugar abacus activity, they conceived and created—with the help of the Sugar developer community—a new abacus that lets children add and subtract fractions (See Figure). Sugar didn't just enable the teachers to invent, it encouraged them to invent.

Guzmán Trinidad, a high-school physics teacher from Montevideo, Uruguay and Tony Forster, a retired mechanical engineer from Melbourne, Australia collaborated on a collection of physics experiments that could be conducted with a pair of alligator clips and a small collection of Sugar applications. In the process of developing their experiments, they maintained regular communication with the developers, submitting bug reports, documentation, feature requests, and the occasional patch. Other examples of teacher and community-based contributions include Proyecto Butiá, a robotics and sensor platform build on top of Sugar (and GNOME) at Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad de la República, Uruguay. Butiá inspired numerous other robotics platforms, e.g., RoDI (Robot Didáctico Inalámbrico) developed in Paraguay, as well as a wealth of projects aligned with the pedagogy of Constructionism. In the spirit of Sugar, these hardware projects were all designed to be "open": schematics and firmware were made available under Free/Libre licenses.

In 2012, we were part of a team running a week-long Sugar workshop for more than 60 teachers who had traveled to Chachapoyas, the regional capital of the Amazonas region of Peru. During the day we spend time reviewing the various Sugar activities and discussing strategies for using Sugar in the classroom. In the evenings, we gave a series of optional workshops on specialized topics. One evening, mid-week, the topic was fixing bugs in Sugar. It was not expected that many teachers would attend—in part because we were competing with an annual festival and in part because their background in programming was minimal. But almost everyone showed up. In the workshop, we walked through the process of fixing a bug in the Sugar Mind Map activity and used git to push a patch upstream. Teachers, especially rural teachers, have a hunger for knowledge about the tools that they use. This is in part due to intellectual curiosity and in part due to necessity: no one is going to make a service call to Amazonas. As purveyors of educational technology we have both a pedagogical and moral obligation to provide the means by which our users can maintain (and modify) our products. Enabling those closest to the learners is in the interest of everyone invested in educational technology as it both ensures viability of the product and it is a valuable source of new ideas and initiatives.

**CAMBRIDGE, MA, USA -- May 8, 2024 -- Sugar Labs today announced its 501(c)(3) nonprofit status as well as its pick for executive director, long-time contributor Devin Ulibarri.**

## Sugar Labs is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit

In 2019, the Sugar Labs oversight board voted to incorporate as its own entity and apply for nonprofit status. After that vote, the members of the board began efforts to leave the Software Freedom Conservancy, incorporate as Sugar Labs Inc., and applied for 501(c)(3) nonprofit status. In the spring of 2021, Sugar Labs Inc. was granted nonprofit status from the IRS.

**More Info:**  
- [Meeting Minutes – May 3, 2019](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Oversight_Board/Meeting_Minutes-2019-05-03)  
- [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/)

## Devin Ulibarri hired as executive director

In January 2024, the board agreed to hire long-time Sugar Labs contributor Devin Ulibarri as their first full-time executive director. Prior to stepping into this role, he worked as the outreach & communications coordinator for the [Free Software Foundation](https://fsf.org).

**More Info:**  
- [Free Software Foundation](https://fsf.org)  
- [Music Blocks](https://www.sugarlabs.org/music-blocks)

Ulibarri has been a part of the Sugar Labs community for ten years, primarily working together with Walter Bender on [Music Blocks](https://www.sugarlabs.org/music-blocks) development. Devin has been an advocate of the work and philosophy of Sugar Labs, giving talks and leading workshops internationally. As a former board member, he also played a major role in helping the organization achieve its current nonprofit status.

Of the hiring, Sugar Labs board member and founder Walter Bender said, "Devin is a dedicated colleague, with deep roots in both Free/Libre Software and the pedagogy of Constructionism. We're thrilled to have Devin in this new role." Ulibarri responded: "I'm excited to serve within this capacity, to help Sugar Labs grow to bring all of its good work to more teachers, parents, and students across the US and, ultimately, around the globe."

## Current leadership

The officers of Sugar Labs Inc. are currently: Devin Ulibarri, executive director; Claudia Urrea, treasurer; and Walter Bender, secretary. The current board is Samson Goddy, Lionel Laské, Claudia Urrea, Walter Bender, and Alex Perez.

If you would like to share your Sugar Story with us as an article for possible publication, please send a draft to_ [_info@sugarlabs.org_](mailto:info@sugarlabs.org)_. Please be aware that there is an editorial process that will require some additional effort and collaboration, even after submission._

I started working with OLPC with the Give One Get One program back in 2007. Honestly speaking, at the time, I was more interested in getting an XO laptop for myself than in working for the project. I thought I could use the laptop to read plain textbooks from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). Kindles were very expensive back then, and this looked like a good alternative. And it was. But, at the time, the Read Activity only worked with PDFs. In an effort to expand this functionality, I taught myself to program in Python, studied the code for the [Read Activity](https://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4028), and created the [Read Etexts Activity](https://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4035), which supported reading plain text files. Next, I decided that I wanted to have an Activity for reading comic books in CBZ format and created two of them: [View Slides](https://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4039) and [Read SD Comics](https://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4340).

At the time, the best, and maybe only, way to learn how to create Activities was to study the code of existing ones. I'm a systems analyst, so that wasn't too difficult for me, since I already had some of the important skills needed to do this. But this situation wasn't great for teachers and their students who may want to create Activities but didn't yet have the skills needed. In 2009 or so, I convinced myself to write a proper manual, which we called [_Make Your Own Sugar Activities!_](https://archive.org/details/MakeYourOwnSugarActivities) I did this using the Floss Manuals website. I was fortunate enough to have a very nice cover illustration done for me by [Oceana Rain Fields](https://archive.flossmanuals.net/make-your-own-sugar-activities/about-the-authors.html), a student participating in the Rural Design Collective's summer mentorship program. The printed book was given out as a door prize at one of the first OLPC conferences. The book was later translated into Spanish by a team of Sugar Labs volunteers as [_Como Hacer Una Actividad Sugar_](https://archive.org/details/ComoHacerUnaActividadSugar).

My personal involvement in Sugar Labs did not require any direct work with children, but, recently, I had the opportunity to introduce a young boy to Sugar. I had an old computer that I was going to give to a family friend, who was studying computer programming in college. His nine-year-old brother found out about it and wanted it for himself, so I installed the latest [Sugar Learning Platform](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/What_is_Sugar#About_the_Sugar_Learning_Platform) and updated my old Activities to run on Python 3. He is pleased to have [the same operating system (OS) used by astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS)](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/gnu-linux-chosen-as-operating-system-of-the-international-space-station) and enjoys playing [Tux Kart](https://supertuxkart.net/Main_Page). I look forward to introducing him to even more that Sugar has to offer in the coming months.

It's nice to have the [Sugar environment](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/What_is_Sugar) as an option for kids, as well as ways for the community to participate in the creation of new Activities.`,vt=Object.freeze(Object.defineProperty({__proto__:null,default:le},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"})),de=`---

# Recent news for September 20, 2024

Welcome to the very first issue of the **"Sweet Spot"**, a newsletter for Sugar Labs-related news in development, student and teacher work, events, how to get involved, and other news and information. This newsletter will be published semi-regularly for now, but the plan is to publish it on a bi-monthly, perhaps even monthly, basis in the future. Our aim with this newsletter is to help keep the growing body of Sugar Labs contributors on the same page, all while documenting our growth for our own and others' reference.

This first issue is meant to set a precedent of communication and documentation, as well as to help inform the community of our current status, recent progress, and future plans. Its predecessor is the ["Sugar Digest"](https://lists.sugarlabs.org/archive/community-news/), which still serves as an important catalog of our activities. Like Sugar Digest, this newsletter is intended to keep community members in the loop about everything going on within Sugar Labs. It will highlight any recent publications from us. It will occasionally include links to third-party news and updates that our community finds relevant.

This first issue has links and "news" from a few months back. Future installments will focus on a more acute timeframe than this inaugural issue, which aims to cover our news since the beginning of this year.

We hope that you enjoy this first issue. And, if you have something you'd like to share, please feel free to email [info@sugarlabs.org](mailto:info@sugarlabs.org). And for those who would like to volunteer in other ways, this edition has a list of volunteer help that we need with Sugar Labs overall.

## Updates

### GSoC and DMP students complete their projects

This year's GSoC and DMP students have completed their work for Sugar Labs. Students were asked to document their progress through blogs and participate in online events showcasing their work at regular intervals throughout the summer.

**Sugar Labs is running an election this fall for three seats to its board of directors. The deadline to apply for a ballot, as well as submit candidacy for the board, is November 24. Sugar Labs community members are encouraged to participate. By submitting an application for a ballot you will also be considered for membership. Current members who do not apply for a ballot will have their membership rescinded.**

The deadline to apply for a ballot and apply for candidacy is fast approaching. Extended to Sunday, the deadline to [apply for a ballot](https://forms.gle/48F6h5wdV6BpSro66) is now November 24, 2024, End of Day (EoD), Anywhere on Earth (AoE). It is also the deadline to [submit for candidacy](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Oversight_Board/2025-2026-candidates#Candidates) for the [board of directors](https://www.sugarlabs.org/leadership/).

### Eligibility to vote

Since we made [our initial announcement](https://www.sugarlabs.org/community/2024/11/08/fall-board-elections-how-to-participate/), one of the most frequently asked questions has been *what determines eligibility for participating in the election?* Participation in the election is open to any member of Sugar Labs, and the eligibility requirements for membership are published on [Sugar Labs Members page](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Members). 

The main gist, however, is that you've made a contribution to Sugar Labs. According to our definition, such a contribution "may be code, documentation, translations, maintenance of project-wide resources, *running a Sugar deployment*, or other non-trivial activities which benefit Sugar Labs."

If you've made such a contribution to Sugar Labs, you are eligible as a member, and, as a member, you may vote. ***Also, if you're not a member or unsure about your status, we still encourage you to submit an application for a ballot.*** We will automatically begin to determine your membership eligibility based on your publicly visible contributions, so no other steps are necessary on your part.

### Current members must vote in this election in order to maintain their membership status

Our most recent membership list may be found [here](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Members/List). If you are currently a member but you do not apply for a ballot to vote in this election, then we will consider your membership to be rescinded and your membership will be made inactive. Because [our bylaws require a majority vote from members to pass certain amendments](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Governance#ARTICLE_XI), we need to ensure that our current membership list is up-to-date with active members.

If you've made a contribution to Sugar Labs in the past, ***we strongly encourage you to vote in this election to maintain your membership status.*** We thank you for your contribution, and we encourage you to continue to participate in Sugar Labs, which is now investing in its growth and expansion like never before.

If it's been a while since you've made a contribution, we encourage you to join us on our main [Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#sugar:matrix.org) and follow us on [GitHub](https://github.com/sugarlabs/). These two channels are currently the most active for coordinating contributions.

### Receive your ballot

We encourage you to vote. The application to receive your ballot, due by the End of Day (EoD), Anywhere on Earth (AoE), November 24, 2024, is [here](https://forms.gle/48F6h5wdV6BpSro66).

### Running for a board position

For those of you who would like to run for a board position, you will need to add your name and statement to the list on the [candidate page](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Oversight_Board/2025-2026-candidates). If you need any technical assistance with the wiki, please contact <elections@sugarlabs.org>.

Candidates should read and understand the terms of the [Sugar Labs Inc.'s Bylaws](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Governance), as well as any domestic and international laws governing participation in a US-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit board.

### Election timeline

The updated timeline of the election is planned as follows, with a deadline to receive ballot applications for the End of Day (EoD), Anywhere on Earth (AoE), November 24, 2024, and a deadline to vote for the end of day on December 13, 2024.

### Election method

After doing research on various [election software recommended by the FLOSS community](https://github.com/sugarlabs/elections-research), we have decided to use [bettervoting.com](http://bettervoting.com). The software is licensed under the AGPLv3, and the system supports automatic runoff vote tallying. Our internal research on the system can be found in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kuXXL-tVgB1Ptu50cTonWtRnAuKmWn1jyKd1qPgqFJY/edit?tab=t.0).

Again, we encourage you to take the first step and apply for a ballot via our [application form](https://forms.gle/48F6h5wdV6BpSro66), and we look forward to your involvement.

**Shared recently on our [mailing list](https://buttondown.com/sugarlabs), Sugar Labs executive director Devin Ulibarri shares his dreams for the organization and how you can help us at this critical moment in our growth.**

Hello,

Sugar Labs is at a critical inflection point. We need your support to leverage some important opportunities to grow.

Consider [donating to Sugar Labs](https://www.paypal.com/donate?campaign_id=NEAV3YL4H6B5S) as we move into our next phase.

![Image that has a picture of volunteers at a desk with computers, a teacher in a class with everyone hands raised, and a teacher overlooking two kids at their computers.](/assets/post-assets/donation-banner.jpg)
*The Sugar Labs community is a global network of students, teachers, and developers.*

I stepped into the executive director position in January of this year. I did so because I believe in Sugar Labs's mission to create educational software and experiences for children.

I also believe in its approach—giving kids the *license* to learn, through free/libre/open (FLO) source software, as well as the *means* to learn through its community of learners and teachers working together to create a fun, safe, and welcoming *learn-by-doing* environment.

Based on my own experience as an educator for more than twenty years, I truly believe this organization has the potential to be a positive, disruptive force in education.

Sugar Labs has a history that dates back almost two decades, with methods (e.g. LOGO, constructionism, project-based learning) that date back more than half a century.

Yet, as an independent nonprofit, the organization itself is basically a startup. Having left our former umbrella organization Software Freedom Conservancy in 2020, we must now take on the challenges inherent to growing our own organization.

This independence brings challenges, such as finding stability and resilience. It also means, however, that we have an opportunity to build the kind of organization that truly serves our mission. I want to invite you to join us at this pivotal moment.

At the time of its founding more than sixteen years ago, Sugar Labs ran exclusively on one platform, created for One Laptop Per Child (OLPC), which was put into the hands of over three million children in over thirty-five countries.

Since that time, Sugar Labs has strategically expanded its scope and renewed its relevance. One way that we've accomplished this is by making the platform available on more devices through Sugar on a Stick (SoaS), maintained as a Fedora "Spin," and Raspberry Pi (RPi)—the latter for which [we made notable improvements over the summer](https://youtu.be/EW0b5OkxXVs).

We also created web-based applications such as Turtle Blocks, Music Blocks, and Sugarizer, which can run on any computer, regardless of operating system.

Music Blocks, in particular, has received recognition as an innovative tool for exploring music and programming.

Perhaps most notably, the Japanese government provided two years of funding to create a version of Music Blocks specifically to help Japan's elementary school students learn programming.

Additionally, Music Blocks was also part of a large-scale deployment of seven-hundred thousand tablets by the Peruvian Ministry of Education.

This year I've spent time ensuring that our finances are stronger and more transparent than ever before. I did this so that charitable donations can be made with confidence, ultimately helping every financial contribution we receive go further.

I won't go into all the details here, but one thing I did is to update and publish our 990s to our website.

All of our tax filings are now up to date and published on [sugarlabs.org/donate](https://www.sugarlabs.org/donate/) under "Our 990 tax filings."

I also helped Sugar Labs secure in-kind services that help our daily operations at no cost to us.

This year, we received Open Source Credits from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that are helping us test and develop new educational software; we received over one-hundred terabytes of data storage through Google Workspace for nonprofits; and we received other in-kind services that are helping us run our organization more efficiently.

I also started a series of live events online where past and current contributors and students have a platform to tell their stories, as well as to invite guests from other organizations to discuss the future of technology-in-education.

I did this because, although Sugar Labs's impact is somewhat obvious to the many who are active in the community, I've found that there are still many untold stories from community members whose lives are impacted positively.

As I've continued to speak to members of the community and published their stories, I've found that these previously untold stories continue to affirm the important role Sugar Labs plays in education.

For example, in [one of my interviews with Ibiam Chihurumnaya](https://youtu.be/JLsUiVzZ5Z0), Ibiam shares how the Sugar Learning Platform and the Sugar community introduced him and his classmates to programming from a young age and has given him skills he continues to use to this very day.

As for our work this summer, Sugar Labs participated in our fourteenth Google Summer of Code (GSoC) to assist students to work on eleven projects.

This, combined with our first-ever participation in Code4GovTech's Dedicated Mentorship Program (DMP), advanced our software development, mentoring a total of fourteen students who worked an estimated five-thousand hours on projects spanning the gamut from *Maintaining and Porting Twelve Activities to Flatpak,* to creating new math games, to creating promising new generative-AI services for both teachers and learners.

To get a better sense of all that we accomplished this summer, you are encouraged to watch the *Finale* series of students' presentations on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SugarlabsOrg-EN).

We're proud of the work we've done so far this year. Yet, we know that we can do even more.

For example, in order to publicly deploy the five generative-AI services we created this summer, we'll need additional computational resources.

We understand that using resources on "AI" may seem like a luxury at this point in time, but we're persuaded that gen-AI will remain as a mainstay technology, and we owe it to our students to assist them in understanding and navigating this technology in a way that empowers them.

Plus, we've already created prototypes, such as an assistant for lesson plan creation and a bot to assist with learning the basics of programming in Python, that we have found to be helpful for our students to learn and cultivate important skills and new ways of looking at the world.

Just as we did when we created web-based software to run on any system or computer, we understand that we'll need to offer learning opportunities in gen-AI in order to stay current and relevant in an ever-evolving landscape.

That said, we haven't compromised on our fundamental values.

All of the services we created over the summer are licensed under a FLO license, allowing for freedom and full transparency so that learners can explore these systems at whatever level satisfies their curiosity.

And, of course, we design our software so that students are empowered to create with these tools and build a portfolio of their work.

All of these projects are exciting for us, and we hope that you're excited about them, too.

However, in order to successfully implement all these projects—plus the myriad grants that I've written, and continue to write—*we must expand our capacity as an organization*. And, in order to increase our capacity, we need to raise funds to hire more staff.

I dream of the day that we have a team of at least ten staff dedicated to assisting schools with their deployments and curricula, conducting ongoing research on how our tools are being used, helping with ongoing software maintenance, and running daily operations.

Having these sorts of resources would help us achieve learning outcomes for students and their teachers.

And it would also free up our volunteer community to focus on what they love about Sugar Labs: working on innovative projects under knowledgeable mentors to build and learn new skills.

We have set an initial goal for this fall of $25k to grow in our second year of operations.

Can you help us in this goal by contributing $3 or more? Your tax-deductible contribution will help us increase our capacity to continue to create innovative tools for learning, together with teachers and learners.

**[Donate to Sugar Labs today](https://www.paypal.com/donate?campaign_id=NEAV3YL4H6B5S)**

Donate today: [https://www.paypal.com/donate?campaign_id=NEAV3YL4H6B5S](https://www.paypal.com/donate?campaign_id=NEAV3YL4H6B5S)

We are hopeful for the future in large part because we've accomplished so much in the past.

We couldn't have gotten to where we are today without the contributions of hundreds of supporters over the years, both financial and volunteer efforts.

We continue to be a unique, positive community and a wonderful place where **youth can solve authentic tasks and learn by doing**.

Looking toward the next three to five years, we want to amplify all the great things in our community—mentorship, learning software, emphasis on problem solving is welcome and encouraged.

Your contribution can help us expand our reach, and it can help us do so much more.

From the bottom of my heart, thank you for reading this message and thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Devin Ulibarri

**Reflections as a parent and teacher: Sugar at home and in the classroom**  
As the year comes to a close, I wanted to take some time to reflect upon how I've used Sugar both in the classroom and at home. I have a few hopes in mind as I share my experience engaging with Sugar both as a teacher and a parent. One hope is that it will show a window into some of the more grounded work Sugar Labs has done this year.

Much of the most recent testimony that we've shared from the [Sugar Labs community](/@sugarlabs) has been centered around software development. While the success of students creating software is certainly important, the purpose of such progress is grounded in helping teachers teach and to help learners learn. Another hope is that the following vignettes will dispel doubts around the efficacy of the Sugar Learning Platform as an effective tool for education, which I've heard from a few folks during conversations throughout [my first year as Sugar Labs's executive director](https://www.sugarlabs.org/press/2024/05/08/Sugar-Labs-announces-nonprofit-status-new-executive-director/). This article will address those doubts directly. My third hope is that my experiences will inspire others, whether parents or teachers (or both), to try Sugar themselves.

## The first few years as a parent

My son Kai was born in 2017, but it was about three years before his birth that I became involved in Sugar Labs. It's a story that I've told in more depth before, but I became interested in Sugar Labs because of their unique approach to education. At the time, I was doing research on the _implications of software-freedom-in-education_, which led me to conclude that the freedoms granted to users in free/libre/open (FLO) source software have [profound positive implications for education](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/File:Education-needs-free-software.pdf). I attended a talk given by Sugar Labs founder Walter Bender, and we soon began working together to integrate music into [Turtle Blocks](http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4027), in what is now known as [Music Blocks visual programming language](https://www.sugarlabs.org/music-blocks/). It was also around this time in 2014 that I received a One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) laptop from Walter that I used to familiarize myself with the Sugar Learning Platform.

Although I had shown Kai a few things on the OLPC when he was a toddler, such as creating a paint program for him in the Turtle Blocks Activity, it wasn't until he was about four years old that he really took to it. His first, most sustained, interest in the computer came when he was learning to read by himself. I remember that his desire to read was basically insatiable. In fact, he had memorized some sections of the graphic novel series _Dog Man_ by [Dav Pilkey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dav_Pilkey), which I had read to him multiple times because he loved it so much. At four years old, Kai had memorized a lot of the story, but he wasn't yet reading himself; he was still dependent on others to read for him. It was at this point that he found the [Speak Activity](http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4038) on his OLPC, and this is when he had a real breakthrough with reading.

![Kai](/assets/post-assets/stories/student1.jpg)
*Kai, with his OLPC, running the Speak Activity on the Sugar Learning Platform.*

The basic way that the Speak Activity works is by taking typed input from a user and speaking it back to them when they press return. I remember Kai walking around the house, finding words on various things around the house, typing those words into the computer, and listening to the result. It was in this way that he memorized the spelling of a few words, and, soon enough, he was creating sentences and telling the computer to speak those words back to him (or to me). It was also around this time that we went on a long family road trip, where Kai sat in the back seat typing various words and sentences and learning more and more about language.

*Kai, helping one of my students get up and running in Sugar for her first time.*

Of course, I kept reading books to him, which is still invaluable to a child's development, but I am confident that the Speak Activity helped Kai become a more independent reader. The following year, Kai entered Kindergarten, where he learned phonics and he's been a solid reader ever since. He's now in second grade, and he often carries a few books around with him every day, everywhere he goes.

## Reflections as a teacher in 2024

This year, I had a few memorable moments as a teacher in the classroom. This year, I mentored high school students in git version control, mentored another teacher in leading a Music Blocks class, and I even taught a group class for kids ages five and six on the Sugar Learning Platform. I'll share a little bit of what I learned from each experience here.

![Student 3](/assets/post-assets/stories/student1.jpg)
*Students in a Music Blocks class led by Rafael Moreno, who I guide as a teacher new to teaching programming.*

Before the summer, I reached out to an acquaintance, Neil Plotnik, who teaches cybersecurity at a nearby high school. I [met Neil during my time at the Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/free-software-in-education-and-free-software-education) (FSF). He suggested that I reach out to the Computer Science (CS) teacher at his high school. Long story short, I spent a few weeks getting these youth ready to help with coding, mainly teaching them how to use git version control. These students had done a few coding projects at their school, but hadn't yet contributed to a community project. They hadn't used git before, which is important to know for software development (and the underlying concepts are important skills for any endeavor), so I spent most of the time showing them the basics. To be honest, I was a little bit surprised to find myself teaching git to a CS class, but I suppose this highlights one of the many reasons why an organization such as Sugar Labs is important. Sugar Labs offers pathways into collaborative software development that textbook coding exercises do not.

Over the summer, I mentored a few contributors for Google Summer of Code (GSoC). A lot of this work is online, on our Medium blog and our YouTube channel. At the same time, however, I also worked with a student of mine, Nathan, who asked to have some internship experience over the summer. I've taught this particular student for almost ten years now. He's taken guitar lessons with me, and he's taken Music Blocks classes with Walter Bender and myself. First, I asked him to create some fun projects for kids, which he did with gusto. You can read about his projects here: [https://musicblocks.net/2024/08/05/nyc-interactive-subway/](https://musicblocks.net/2024/08/05/nyc-interactive-subway/) and [https://musicblocks.net/2024/07/18/sitar-tabla-and-tampura-for-makey-makey/](https://musicblocks.net/2024/07/18/sitar-tabla-and-tampura-for-makey-makey/). Then, I asked him to create lesson plans, which he also did very well. And then, near the end of the summer, I involved him with testing some of the latest development for Music Blocks, which included a few [AI projects](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyTz5XRZyi-xR5NGo1fHLbYJYo2OwRFta). Testing these required that he set up a development environment, test the software as a user, and report the results as issues on GitHub. His work over the summer marked a good amount of growth and progress, which continues to this day.

![Student 6](/assets/post-assets/stories/student6.jpg)
*Nathan, testing new features for Music Blocks.*

At the beginning of the school year in the fall, I began mentoring a fellow teacher who is leading a Music Blocks class on a weekly basis. I provide the teacher, Rafael Moreno, guidance in lesson planning and feedback on classes. Rafael is a singer from Panama, now living in Boston, MA, working as a teaching artist.

Also in the fall, I started teaching kindergarten and first grade students in a weekly computer class. This class happens at the same time as Rafael teaches Music Blocks. We decided to split the group by age, and I decided that my (younger) group would benefit most from doing something a little more open ended and basic. So, for the first day, I prepared some OLPC laptops for the kids, and I had them just try the Speak Activity. They had a blast. At one point, I tried to show them another Activity, but they insisted on continuing with the Speak Activity. The following week, we had a new student and I didn't have more than two OLPCs, so I prepared two Thinkpad X1s with Sugar Toast installed for the new student and for Kai, who joined us that day to show the group what else the computers could do. Kai did a wonderful job leading this second day of classes, and it was heartwarming to see him share his knowledge with his new friends in the class. As of now, I've taught this class for a few months, and the kids have explored several of the Activities, including [Maze](http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4071), [Write](http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4201), [Chat](http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4069), [Turtle Blocks](http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4027), and several of the [games](http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/browse/type:1/cat:60). At the end of each class, the kids are asked to share with the class what they're working on. And, on the last day of class before the break, they presented their work to their parents.

![Student 4](/assets/post-assets/stories/student4.jpg)
*Two of my students, smiling during their second class, using the Sugar Learning Platform on two OLPCs.*

One of the things that strikes me the most from this particular class is the _joy_ that the kids show as they're working on their activities. It reminds me of a study I read by Bloom, described in Robert J. Trotter's article for _Psychology Today_, July 1986, "The Mystery of Mastery". Studying how people achieve mastery, Bloom observed a few common factors among those who became experts as adults. The children who later became experts were introduced to the field as a playful activity, and learning at this stage was "like a game." As for Sugar, the kids in my class are learning a lot of things in the class, such as spelling, typing, and language, but the playfulness they exhibit is developmentally appropriate. This is consistent with the research on human development, and I've found it to hold true during my own work in the classroom.

![Process](/assets/post-assets/stories/process.jpg)
*Here are the notes I took in college that I used to reference the above paragraph. I add it here because I no longer have access to the original article, and I could not find a copy online. If you find a link to a electronic copy, please drop it into the comments below.*

## Conclusions

As I alluded to earlier, I have sometimes heard criticism of the Sugar Learning Platform, suspecting that it may be out of touch with the needs of the students. The criticism is typically accompanied by an argument that youth should be preparing for job skills by using a platform more similar to what an office worker uses (e.g. _Shouldn't the kids be taught how to use Microsoft Word instead?_). However, as an educator, I've never bought that argument. And now that I've spent ten years with Sugar — both as an educator and as a parent — I wholly reject it. I can say confidently that youth learn very important skills through their engagement with Sugar. And perhaps most importantly, they are introduced to concepts in stages that are appropriate to their development.

![Student 5](/assets/post-assets/stories/student5.jpg)
*One of the students in my Sugar class. She surprised me by coming in with this hand-drawn computer, which she made just a few days after taking one of her first classes.*

I'm more proud than I ever have been to be a part of the Sugar community, and my decades' long experience with youth from ages five through college, only gives me stronger conviction that we're creating something of unique value for education.`,Pt=Object.freeze(Object.defineProperty({__proto__:null,default:pe},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"})),me=`---

# Recent news for December 29, 2024

Welcome to the second issue of the **"Sweet Spot"**, a newsletter for Sugar Labs-related news in development, student and teacher work, events, how to get involved, and other news and information. This newsletter will be published semi-regularly for now, but the plan is to publish it on a bi-monthly, perhaps even monthly, basis in the future. Our aim with this newsletter is to help keep the growing body of Sugar Labs contributors on the same page, all while documenting our growth for our own and others' reference.

These first issues are meant to set a precedent of communication and documentation, as well as to help inform the community of our current status, recent progress, and future plans. Its predecessor is the [Sugar Digest](https://lists.sugarlabs.org/archive/community-news/), which still serves as an important catalog of our activities. Like Sugar Digest, this newsletter is intended to keep community members in the loop about everything going on within Sugar Labs. It will highlight any recent publications from us. It will occasionally include links to third-party news and updates that our community finds relevant.

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

A few times in recent months, we received questions from folks about how to buy Sugar. Until now, the only response we had was that we didn't offer them for sale but that you could [create your own by following our instructions](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick/Installation). If you wanted to [run Sugar on a Stick](https://www.sugarlabs.org/booting-soas/), you had to flash a USB drive yourself before using it.

Of course, flashing a USB can be a great educational experience, and this will remain an option. However, what we heard from people asking this question was that they wanted a few things that they couldn't get from flashing a USB themselves. 

One is that they wanted the **convenience—and added assurance—of purchasing a USB from a reputable vendor**. Another is that some people were expecting something **branded with the Sugar Labs logo**. For some, it may be the ability to **gift a USB** for a friend or teacher. And, for the majority who reached out to us, it seemed that they wanted a way to **pay us for the software**, and, in so doing, **help sustain our work for years to come**.

Well, we're excited to share the news that you are **now able to purchase a Sugar Labs-branded USB with Sugar on a Stick pre-installed!**

![Two USB drives on a laptop. The Sugar Labs logo is prominent, and the drives are shiny.](/assets/post-assets/sugarlabs_soas_usb-two.jpg?w=960&amp;fit=max)
*Samples of two USBs with Sugar on a Stick pre-installed. All profits from purchases will go to Sugar Labs to help develop current and future learning projects.*


We partnered up with USB Memory Direct for this particular offering. USB Memory Direct (UMD) has a history of supporting [free/libre/open source projects such as ours](https://www.sugarlabs.org/about-us/). They will also be handling inventory and shipping & handling, which means that we at Sugar Labs can keep focusing on what we do best: create learning software for education! Plus, UMD will give **all profits from sales to Sugar Labs**, which we will use to further our mission in Constructionist education.

Now that we have both clothing merchandise and SoaS USBs for purchase, we created a new [product page](https://www.sugarlabs.org/product/). 

- 🧁 [Buy Sugar on a Stick (SoaS) USBs](https://www.usbmemorydirect.com/store/novelty/sugarlabs/)
- 👕 [Buy Sugar Labs clothing merch](https://www.bonfire.com/store/sugar-labs-merch/)

Detailed product information and specifications are on the respective landing pages.

If you purchase a USB or clothing merchandise, **please let us know about it!** You can either [contact us](https://www.sugarlabs.org/contact-us/) directly, or you can create a post on social media with the hashtag [#SugarLabs](https://mastodon.social/tags/sugarlabs) for us to find.

📹 And if you create a video of your experience on YouTube, let us know and we can add it to [our Sugar on a Stick playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyTz5XRZyi-xuPdS7kReqP5Nu5TAlTu4f).

# Annual report for 2024

This report is meant to be an overview of the work Sugar Labs did in 2024. Looking back, we did a lot of work. We participated in events in the US and India. We mentored more than a dozen students over the summer for Google Summer of Code and the Dedicated Mentorship Program, the latter of which we participated in for the first time last year.

We launched a series of online videos to showcase our work to the public while simultaneously giving a platform for young contributors to reflect upon their progress and be introduced to a larger developer community. We created a handful of entirely new software projects for learning, such as new math games and Sugarizer activities. We improved our existing software—implementing new features, fixing bugs, and making our learning software available on more platforms. We did all this and more in 2024, which I detail below.

In many aspects, this report is highly personal. I share about my own journeys to conferences, photos of the people I met, and the students to whom I introduced Sugar. In 2024, I became Sugar Labs's first full-time staff member, which helped me fully dedicate myself to many aspects of the organization. We were also able to sponsor community members like Anindya Kundu to represent Sugar Labs internationally.

As you read this report, please understand that the vision for Sugar Labs as a nonprofit organization is to grow to be able to support more and more people like myself, so we can have an even wider reach. That said, Sugar Labs, being a free/libre/open source community-driven project, makes its tools available to the public under free licenses, so anyone may use what we've created to support teachers and classrooms in their communities, regardless of their "status" within the organization.

In other words, Sugar Labs is *not* a one-man-band. Instead, it's a community of orchestras and ensembles. The organization is meant to support those orchestras and ensembles, comprised of teachers and learners, listening to and responding to their needs.

It is my hope that 2025's annual report includes even more stories and photos from the broader Sugar Labs community. Sugar Labs welcomes your interest, support, and contributions. I encourage you to join our community of teachers, learners, and parents working together to create better tools and a supportive environment for learning.

I hope the annual publication of our work in the form of an executive summary will serve as a benchmark as we work toward continuous self-improvement as a nonprofit dedicated to serving our community of teachers and learners.

## Development in 2024

### Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and Dedicated Mentorship Program (DMP)

As for our work this summer, Sugar Labs participated in our fourteenth Google Summer of Code (GSoC) to assist students in working on [eleven projects](https://www.sugarlabs.org/press/2024/05/01/Sugar-Labs-receives-eleven-contributor-projects-for-GSoC-2024/). This, combined with our first-ever participation in Code4GovTech's Dedicated Mentorship Program (DMP), advanced our software development, mentoring a total of fourteen students who worked an estimated five thousand hours on projects ranging from maintaining and porting twelve activities to Flatpak, to creating new math games, to promising new generative-AI services for both teachers and learners.

To get a better sense of all that we accomplished this summer, you are encouraged to watch the Finale series of students' presentations on our YouTube channel at [https://www.youtube.com/@SugarlabsOrg-EN](https://www.youtube.com/@SugarlabsOrg-EN).

We also encourage you to check out the work in more detail by reading the reports published on Medium:

- [https://medium.com/@sugarlabs/list/google-summer-of-code-d90eae4b54fb](https://medium.com/@sugarlabs/list/google-summer-of-code-d90eae4b54fb)

## Outreach and communications

### Online events

In 2024, I started a series of live events online where past and current contributors and students have a platform to tell their stories, as well as invite guests from other organizations to discuss the future of technology in education.

I did this because, although Sugar Labs's impact is obvious to many in the community, I've found that there are still many untold stories from community members whose lives have been impacted by our work. Publishing these stories has continued to affirm the important role Sugar Labs plays in education.

For example, in [my interview with Ibiam Chihurumnaya](https://youtu.be/JLsUiVzZ5Z0), he shared how the Sugar Learning Platform and community introduced him and his classmates to programming from a young age and gave him skills he continues to use to this day.

### Expanded social media presence

Last year, we expanded our presence on social media. In addition to Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and LinkedIn, we are now on Bluesky, WhatsApp, and my personal favorite, Mastodon.

If you are on any of these platforms, please follow Sugar Labs and boost our posts to support our outreach. If you're interested in helping with our outreach, join our marketing mailing list and express your interest: [https://lists.sugarlabs.org/listinfo/marketing](https://lists.sugarlabs.org/listinfo/marketing).

### Reboot of regular newsletters

In 2024, we relaunched regular newsletters, now sent approximately once every three months. These newsletters share our progress as an organization and news valuable to our community:

- [https://www.sugarlabs.org/community/2024/09/20/sweet-spot/](https://www.sugarlabs.org/community/2024/09/20/sweet-spot/)
- [https://www.sugarlabs.org/community/2024/12/29/sweet-spot-002/](https://www.sugarlabs.org/community/2024/12/29/sweet-spot-002/)

### Newsletter email subscription

Our newsletters are published to the website and also sent via email. In 2024, we started using Buttondown to send newsletters to subscribers worldwide. If you're not subscribed yet, please do so: [https://buttondown.com/sugarlabs](https://buttondown.com/sugarlabs).

### Reboot of Sugar Stories

In 2024, we began collecting stories from our community. While it's still early, we've already received some fantastic articles.

- From [James Simmons](https://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/user/45): [Helping others to create their own Sugar Activities](https://www.sugarlabs.org/stories/2024/09/13/Writing-new-Activities-and-sharing-sugar-with-youth/)
- From me: [Reflections as Parents and Teachers](https://www.sugarlabs.org/stories/2024/12/25/Reflections-as-Parents-and-Teachers-Sugar-at-home-and-in-their-classroom/)

You can read these and more at: [https://www.sugarlabs.org/sugar-stories/](https://www.sugarlabs.org/sugar-stories/)

If you have a story, share it via [info@sugarlabs.org](mailto:info@sugarlabs.org) or through the mailing lists:

- Education: [https://lists.sugarlabs.org/listinfo/iaep](https://lists.sugarlabs.org/listinfo/iaep)
- Development: [https://lists.sugarlabs.org/listinfo/sugar-devel](https://lists.sugarlabs.org/listinfo/sugar-devel)

### Major improvements to our website

Throughout 2024, I worked on updating our website, which needed attention. Being unfamiliar with Jekyll (the framework it's built on), I struggled at first, but with help from the free software community, I learned enough to begin publishing updates more regularly.

Near the end of the year, more folks from the development community pitched in. Now, the site is in much better shape, and we are working toward a completely revamped version set to launch in April 2025.

Thanks to the many volunteers who helped! Interested in joining the web team? Visit [https://matrix.to/#/#sugarlabs-web:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#sugarlabs-web:matrix.org).

### Conference talks

In 2024, we sent representatives to a few in-person conferences. With limited budget, we focused on visibility, sending me to several conferences in the US and sponsoring Anindya Kundu to represent us at the Opportunity Open Source Conference at IIT Kanpur.

### - LibrePlanet

In May, I attended the Free Software Foundation's annual LibrePlanet conference in Boston, MA. There, I [handed out flyers](https://mstdn.io/@codewiz/112384505018899979) and showed off a computer running the Sugar Desktop Environment.

### - 2024 Micro Camp

In June, I spent a weekend at a 2024 Micro Camp, a retreat for microtonal musicians, where I showcased the Music Blocks visual programming language. Music Blocks, a flagship Sugar Labs project, has rich microtonal capabilities. I showcased those features during one of the first talks of the retreat, and I even used Music Blocks as a musical instrument to perform a piece of music that requires twenty-two divisions of the octave—something for which I did not have a capable physical instrument, except for [a programmed instrument I created within Music Blocks](https://musicblocks.sugarlabs.org/index.html?id=1719093905649087&run=True).

At the conference, I was also pleasantly surprised to meet so many free/libre/open source developers and educators. A large percentage—much larger than at most music conferences—were developing software. In retrospect, it makes sense that there are so many microtonalists who develop software, because these musicians typically need to create instruments that play pitches differently from what you would find in most stores, and they use both physical and digital mediums to craft such unique instruments.

### - CMK

In July, I attended Constructing Modern Knowledge (CMK), a retreat for teachers, in Manchester, NH. This retreat is a good fit for Sugar Labs as it is focused on Constructionism. CMK brings together passionate educators from around the world to work on new and creative projects, which they bring back to their respective schools.

### - FOSSY 2024

In August, I attended FOSSY, hosted by the Software Freedom Conservancy, in Portland, OR. I gave a talk titled "[Mentoring youth: The FOSS strategy we've been looking for](https://2024.fossy.us/schedule/presentation/202/)". You can watch the talk on our YouTube channel at  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKBXSC9Veq8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKBXSC9Veq8).

I also ran two Birds of a Feather sessions. One was a Music Blocks workshop, where Bryan Ollendyke of [HAX](https://hax.psu.edu/) tested the limits of the JavaScript editor in Music Blocks. The other was a free/libre/open (FLO) music concert, where I joined [Aaron Wolf](https://blog.snowdrift.coop/author/wolftune/), [Timmy Barnett](https://gnulinux.love/), [Kite Giedraitis](https://tallkite.com/), and others to showcase [FLO](https://wiki.snowdrift.coop/about/free-libre-open) through instruments, software, and a variety of music.

### - Internet-in-a-box demonstration

Also in August, I attended a meetup to demonstrate [Internet-in-a-box](https://internet-in-a-box.org/) (IIAB), led by [Adam Holt](https://github.com/holta). Kids and teachers got an opportunity to see what IIAB does and to try it. [Sugarizer](https://sugarizer.org/), the web-based version of the Sugar Learning Platform, is among the packages chosen for IIAB, which empowers schools to use learning services that would otherwise require an internet connection.

### - GSoC Mentor Summit

Sugar Labs has participated in GSoC almost every year since 2009. This year, we worked on a number of projects. I was sent to represent Sugar Labs at the conference, hosted at Google headquarters. I met with other mentors, attended talks, and gave a lightning talk on our unique approaches to mentoring.

## Sugar Labs in the Classroom

### Music Blocks

This year marked significant progress in research and development for the Music Blocks visual programming language. Alongside the development work done during GSoC over the summer, I explored every opportunity to bring the new features to students, teachers, and classrooms.

I collaborated with one of my students, Nathan, who has studied music with me for about a decade and has also taken over a year of Music Blocks classes directly from Walter Bender. Together, we tested the new AI features, such as MIDI import, as well as experimental features like music transcription and lesson plan generators.

During the same period, I worked closely with teachers who were preparing innovative Music Blocks lessons. They provided valuable feedback by reporting bugs and suggesting new feature requests based on their classroom experiences.

![Nathan](/assets/post-assets/2024-annual-report/image22.jpg)
*Nathan (at back) has studied with Devin for ten years. Over the summer, Nathan came in regularly to test new Music Blocks features that were being developed as part of Google Summer of Code.*

![Musician and programmer duo](/assets/post-assets/2024-annual-report/image12.jpg)
*Two instructors for a summer camp at MAP Family Learning Center worked together to create lessons for different themes, such as Egypt, Spain, and India. One instructor is primarily a programmer, the other is a Berklee-trained musician.*

![Lesson plan generator](/assets/post-assets/2024-annual-report/image14.jpg)
*One of the projects for GSoC was a LLM-enabled lesson plan generator. Nathan (at right) and I tested it as we were helping the instructors create lesson plans for five weeks of summer classes.*

![Music+Code](/assets/post-assets/2024-annual-report/image38.jpg)
*Nathan was eventually recruited to help the instructors create lesson plans. He utilized his knowledge and understanding of both music and programming to create projects for the students.*

![Musical debugging](/assets/post-assets/2024-annual-report/image16.jpg)
*Nathan created unique projects for Music Blocks, which are now uploaded to the Planet. He had to debug both the music and the logic in order to make his projects work.*

![Summer fun](/assets/post-assets/2024-annual-report/image2.jpg)
*Lesson plans created by Nathan and the two teachers were used over the summer. The students had a great time, and we received important feedback to improve Music Blocks.*

### Sugar Learning Platform and Sugar Activities

In the fall, I began teaching a small group of kindergarten and first-grade students using the Sugar Learning Platform. We started with a few One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) laptops and later transitioned to newer hardware. The students quickly fell in love with their computers — calling the chat robot their "robot friend" — and eagerly created art, composed music, and played educational games.

Our sessions covered a variety of topics, from spelling to problem-solving. The foundation we built early on eventually led to the students learning to program using Turtle Blocks. The class is ongoing, and it has been both a joy for the students and an insightful experience for me.

Additionally, my time in the classroom has allowed me to provide valuable feedback to developers for future improvements to the platform.

![First introduction](/assets/post-assets/2024-annual-report/image44.jpg)
*Devin ran "Sugar classes" for kindergarten and second grade in the fall.*

![Robot friend](/assets/post-assets/2024-annual-report/image31.png)
*The students in Devin's class expressed much joy as they explored the tools in Sugar.*

![Computer surprise](/assets/post-assets/2024-annual-report/image18.jpg)
*Soon after the computers were introduced to the students, one student brought in her own computer. She had drawn a computer with a monitor and keyboard, modeled after her experience using Sugar.*

![Students helping students](/assets/post-assets/2024-annual-report/image24.jpg)
*Devin's son Kai (at right) helped the students in their first weeks.*

![First steps](/assets/post-assets/2024-annual-report/image6.jpg)
*At first, the computers took some getting used to. Now, the students understand the basics.*

![Joyful learning](/assets/post-assets/2024-annual-report/image46.jpg)
*The students had a blast learning together with the Sugar Learning Platform.*

### Teaching Git to Students of Everett High School

In the spring, a couple of teachers at a local high school approached me about training their students in collaborative software development practices. I met with the students twice and followed up with them via email and group chat to support their learning journey.
Together, we covered the basics of Git version control, using the command line, and making their first contributions to our repositories. It was a rewarding experience that gave the students practical skills and an introduction to open source collaboration.

![First inception into git](/assets/post-assets/2024-annual-report/image28.jpg)
*The high school students were eager to contribute. Contributing to free/libre/open source projects like Sugar Labs typically requires version-control collaborative tools like git.*

![Students and teachers of Everett High School](/assets/post-assets/2024-annual-report/image42.jpg)
*Devin (at left) met with the students of Everett High School two times to get them started as contributors for Sugar Labs.*

## Finances

Last year, I spent time working on our finances — where we keep our money, which platforms can be used to donate to our organization, and increasing the number of financial tools available to us. I did this work primarily to ensure that charitable donations can be made with confidence, ultimately helping every contribution we receive go further.

One of the major improvements I made to increase financial transparency was updating and publishing our 990 tax filings. All of our tax documents are now up to date and publicly available on our [donations page](https://www.sugarlabs.org/donate/) under the section "Our 990 tax filings."

In addition, I helped Sugar Labs secure in-kind services that directly support our day-to-day operations at no cost. This year, we received:

- **Open Source Credits from AWS**: These credits are helping us test and develop new educational software.
- **Over 100 terabytes of data storage** through Google Workspace for Nonprofits.
- **Other in-kind services** that allow us to run more efficiently and at a lower cost.

Lastly, I laid the groundwork for accepting financial contributions through a wide variety of platforms, including ACH, stocks, and even cryptocurrency. We were also added to the PayPal Giving Fund, which makes us discoverable through multiple corporate donation programs. Employers can now support Sugar Labs via Benevity, and all these channels are now live as of 2025 — a result of the foundational work completed in 2024.

### In-kind Donations

We received eleven ThinkPads (X1 Yogas) from Beacon Communities, LLC in April. These laptops feature touchscreens — a particularly useful feature for children — and have been used to teach both Sugar Activities and Music Blocks effectively.

![Installing Trisquel on the donated machines](/assets/post-assets/2024-annual-report/image47.jpg)
*Trisquel is a distribution of GNU/Linux that offers a version for download that has the Sugar Learning Platform as its default.*

![Super Tux](/assets/post-assets/2024-annual-report/image19.jpg)
*The computers were received near the end of the school year, so the obvious way to test them out was to let the kids play with them.*

![Teacher and intern training](/assets/post-assets/2024-annual-report/image1.jpg)
*The donated computers helped us train teachers and interns to use Music Blocks.*

![Nine upcycled computers](/assets/post-assets/2024-annual-report/image27.jpg)
*These nine computers are now property of Sugar Labs. They've been used since we've received them to teach Sugar and Music Blocks, as well as to test new code created by GSoC participants.*

![Multimedia](/assets/post-assets/2024-annual-report/image36.jpg)
*Students are able to interact with the computers via touch and with a mouse. They also ahve headphones they can use to hear sounds from the computers.*

### AWS Open Source Credits

In 2024, we applied for and were awarded **open-source credits worth $8,000** from Amazon Web Services (AWS). These credits will help us continue testing and developing the large language model (LLM) and neural network services we worked on over the summer.

### New Sugar Labs Merchandise for Sale

We added a fun twist to our fundraising efforts last year! Inspired by the community reaching out with questions like *"How can I buy Sugar?"*, we launched a variety of branded merchandise.

We now offer:

- **Clothing items** – Hoodies and t-shirts in a range of colors.
- **SoaS (Sugar on a Stick) USBs** – Bootable drives ready for use.

To minimize overhead and simplify logistics, we partnered with two trusted vendors:

- [**Bonfire**](https://www.bonfire.com/store/sugar-labs/) for apparel  
- [**USB Memory Direct**](https://www.usbmemorydirect.com/) for USB drives

All proceeds directly support Sugar Labs' mission to create educational software based on Constructionist learning principles.

![Landing page for USBs](/assets/post-assets/2024-annual-report/image15.png)

This is the first update report on the MusicBlocks JavaScript editor enhancement project for 
GSoC 2025. This and future reports will discuss the progress and future plans for the improvement 
of user experience and features for the editor.

### Upcoming Features
This project aims to significantly enhance the JavaScript editor within Sugar Labs'
MusicBlocks environment. By implementing translation from JavaScript code to
MusicBlocks visual blocks, users will gain a powerful tool for iterative learning and code
exploration. Additionally, the project will introduce a JavaScript visualizer for step-by-step
debugging and syntax highlighting to improve the editor's usability and appeal to young
learners. This upgrade will bridge the gap between visual programming and text-based coding,
promoting a deeper understanding of real programming and empowering kids to debug
effectively.

### Motivation
I believe that kids cannot learn to
code without coding. Although they can learn the concept of coding through MusicBlocks, they
still cannot learn text-based coding effectively. The JavaScript-to-MusicBlocks conversion feature
will enable them to better transition between visual block-based programming and
textual JavaScript coding. This promotes a deeper understanding of programming concepts and
has kids learn them more effectively. 

Even more important than learning how to code is learning how to problem solve. Debugging and 
problem solving skills provide kids with the knowledge to overcome problems of any kind, not 
just in programming. With the step by step debugger, kids will learn how to break a problem down, and 
identify where problems are and track them. 

### JavaScript to Music Blocks
The JavaScript to Music Blocks feature is fairly simple as an end product: implementing the ability
for users to convert the JavaScript code in the editor to music blocks. The execution of this feature 
is less simple. Currently, I have implemented support for all blocks from the rhythm, flow, number, and boolean palettes. There is also support for a few blocks from the pitch, tone, and action palettes. These implementations can be seen with the [first PR](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/pull/4591) and the [second PR](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/pull/4692).

This was all done using the following process:

1. Using the [acorn parser library](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn), convert the input code by the user in the editor into an
[**Abstract Syntax Tree**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) (AST)
2. Convert the AST into a custom intermediate representation
    - In this case, it is a simpler tree consisting of all the different blocks that the code creates
    - For each block in the intermediate tree, there is information on its type, arguments, children, and/or value if it has one
3. Convert the intermediate tree into a blocklist
    - MusicBlocks generate blocks using the representation of a list of blocks, which are mostly in the form of  
    [id, name, x, y, [connections]]
    - Carefully parsing through the intermediate tree and dealing with the connections produce a list of such blocks,
    which MusicBlocks will then load into the visual programming blocks
    - The connections are made during the process of creating the blocks. 
        - For each block, if it has arguments, they will be created and connected with the block
        - Then its children are created and connected to each other
        - Finally the first child is then connected back to the block itself
    - During this process, vertical sizes of arguments are kept track of to insert the necessary amount of vertical spacers before the children

Although this process is proven to work very well as shown by the [merged PR](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/pull/4591), 
adding future blocks is not yet as simple as it can be.

Thus, I am currently working on refactoring the code to use JSON config files to store pairs of AST to block mappings, which would
make adding new blocks an extremely quick and trivial process. The next report may go into more details on this.

### Debugger
The JavaScript editor debugger will be a tool located as a separate tab within the console space. I plan on implementing this tool as part of GSoC this summer. Although currently unavailable, I have created a simple design as to what it may look like.
![JSeditor debugger](/assets/post-assets/debugger.png)

The debugger will have the following functionalities:
 - Ability to set one or multiple breakpoints
 - Have the state of all variables at breakpoints 
 - Show function call frames
 - User can run program all the way to the next breakpoint (stops in order until user goes to next one)
 - User can step forward line by line or evaluate by unit

### Syntax Highlighting
A good IDE or code editor will always have syntax highlighting. This makes the environment easier and more fun to work with. Thus,
this feature will also be added to the JavaScript editor in MusicBlocks. Although this also has not been implemented yet, I foresee this
part of the project being the fastest, as there are many established libraries that can provide syntax highlighting. Some candidates may include highlight.js, and CodeJar.

# Week 01 Progress Report by Aditya Kumar Singh

**Project:** [Sugarizer](https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer)   
**Mentors:** [Lionel Laské](https://github.com/llaske)   
**Assisting Mentors:** [Samarth Bagga](https://github.com/SamarthBagga)   
**Reporting Period:** 2025-05-12 - 2025-05-18   

---

## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** Identify missing human body assets in the current execution.
- **Goal 2:** Simplify models and increase spacing between organs.
- **Goal 3:** Remove redundant code from the current codebase and improve structure.

---

## This Week’s Achievements

1. **Identify missing human body assets in the current execution**  
   - Reviewed current assets and mapped out missing organs and systems (e.g., stomach, intestines, food pipe, kidneys, liver, eyes, brain, etc).  
   - This helps ensure educational completeness and anatomical accuracy for users.

2. **Simplify Z-Anatomy models and increase spacing between organs**  
   - Removed mesh clutter and enhanced spacing between vital organs like heart, lungs, liver to improve visibility and user interaction.
   - This change is aimed at improving user experience, especially on touch devices.

   ![screenshot-description](https://i.ibb.co/hx8MSh0n/Screenshot-2025-05-14-130802.png)  


3. **Remove redundant code from the current codebase and improve structure**  
   - Removed redundant or deprecated functions, improved file modularity, and standardized naming across \`activities\\HumanBody.activity\\js\\activity.js\`.
   - Resolved duplicate \`loader.load()\` usage: Consolidated the skeleton model loading logic into a reusable function and invoked it from both \`env.getEnvironment\` and \`onNetworkDataReceived\`, removing redundancy.
   - Optimized \`env.getEnvironment\` call: Now invoked only once and the result is reused where needed
   - Unified zoom functions: Replaced \`zoomInFunction\`, \`zoomOutFunction\`, \`zoomEqualFunction\`, and \`zoomToFunction\` with a single parameterized \`zoomCamera(type, targetFOV)\` function to streamline logic.
   - Links : PR [#1794](https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer/pull/1794).

---

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Code duplication across multiple model load functions and zoom handlers.  
  **Solution:** Abstracted the model loading into one reusable function to reduce maintenance overhead. Similarly, created a generalized zoom function with parameters for FOV and zoom type to replace multiple similar methods.

- **Challenge:** Finding suitable 3D models with the right level of mesh detail.  
  **Solution:** Spent time evaluating and testing various anatomy models and 3D datasets. Balanced between model quality and performance ensuring the mesh was detailed enough for educational use but light enough for smooth rendering in Sugarizer’s environment.

---

## Key Learnings

- Got hands-on with **3D modeling tools like Blender** for optimization and export for web use.
- Understood modular design and best practices for maintaining scalable code in large open-source projects.

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Refine the 3D models ,remove and merge unecessary parts.
- Integrate Organs 3D models for the basic paint activity.
- Import and test Human Body model for visual alignment.

---

## Goals for This Week

- **Goal:** Complete and deploy code to blocks functionality.

---

## This Week’s Achievements

**Refactored code to be config driven**  
I refactored my code for code to block conversion to use a JSON config file so that the logic behind the conversion is as generic as possible.
An example config for a block is shown below:

         {
            "name": "repeat",
            "comments": "Repeat block in the Flow palette",
            "arguments": [
                {
                    "type": "NumberExpression"
                }
            ],
            "ast": {
                "identifiers": [
                    {
                        "property": "type",
                        "value": "ForStatement"
                    }
                ],
                "argument_properties": [
                    "test.right"
                ],
                "children_properties": [
                    "body.body"
                ]
            },
            "blocklist_connections": [
                "parent_or_previous_sibling",
                "argument",
                "first_child",
                "next_sibling"
            ],
            "default_vspaces": {
                "argument": 1
            }
         }

This config is for the repeat block, as conveniently stated in the comments section for readability. 
There are several pieces of information we need for a block for the conversion code to work:
- The name of the block
- The number of arguments, and their types
- The associated AST information
   - The identifiers, or the path to that block (needed for matching)
   - The paths to the argument and children properties from the AST
- The connections the block has in the blocklist [parent/previous sibling, argument(s), child(ren), next sibling]
- vspace information

Based on these pieces of information, the conversion code is generic enough to parse through and translate into blocklist format.
This is very important because this means that adding a new block for support is now as simple as adding a config like this to the JSON file.

---

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Coming up with the config format.

  **Solution:** Lots of trial and error, and using many different examples to make the code generic.

- **Challenge:** Argument handling was not working with configuration.

  **Solution:** Added a separate section in the config file for argument blocks, but made it as close to other blocks as possible.

---

## Key Learnings

- Deepened understanding of JSON configuration files.
- Improved skills in **debugging**, **code design**, and **collaboration workflows**.

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Fully add all blocks that we want to support for code to block conversion, with corresponding documentation and error handling.
- Move on to next phase of the JSeditor project, which is the debugger
- Familiarize myself with the necessary files I will need to work with for the debugger
- Work on getting breakpoints to work

# Week 1 Progress Report by Aman Naik

**Project:** [Add an AI-assistant to the Write Activity](https://github.com/sugarlabs/write-activity/issues/52)  
**Mentors:** [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender), [Ibiam Chihurumnaya](https://github.com/chimosky)  
**Reporting Period:** 2025-06-02 - 2025-06-08  

---

## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** Understand write activity's codebase.
- **Goal 2:** Explore pertinent grammar correction models for real time grammar correction
- **Goal 3:** Understand the [Abiword](https://github.com/AbiWord) word-processor documentation

---

## This Week’s Achievements

1. **Understood the activity's codebase**  
   - Gained a clear understanding of the overall structure and logic of the Write activity's codebase.
   - This includes identifying key components, data flow, and how the Abiword processor is leveraged for this activity.
2. **Explored pertinent grammar correction models**  
   - Shortlisted grammar correction models suitable for real time grammar correction and can be used with an open source software.
   - Created API endpoints using Hugging Face spaces for quick testing in sugar.

3. **Understood the Abiword processor**  
   - Abiword is an open source word processor, which is leveraged by the write activity.
   - It has a parser called 'link-grammar' that was recently developed, which might be useful for grammar correction as well.

---

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Difficulty in finding reliable grammar correction models on hugging face which can also be compatible open source software.  
**Solution:** Found link-grammar that could be an option for reliable grammar correction feature. Also, found some hugging face models(relevant license) after rigorously searching. 

- **Challenge:** Testing hugging face models with no inference points and testing them inside Sugar.  
**Solution:** Most Hugging Face models can’t be installed directly in Sugar because they require heavy dependencies like Torch and Transformers, which increase memory usage in a virtual machine. Therefore, I used hugging face spaces and ran the models there, which also provides API endpoints for quick testing inside Sugar.

---

## Key Learnings

- Gained a solid understanding of the Write activity's code structure and how it integrates the Abiword processor.
- Explored lightweight, open-source grammar correction models and successfully tested them using Hugging Face Spaces via API endpoints.
- Discovered that Abiword’s link-grammar parser might be leveraged for native grammar correction within the activity.

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Finalise a grammar correction model and fine tune it if needed
- Create a FastAPI endpoint and upload the selected model on AWS for testing
- Integrate grammar correction into write-activity
- Explore better spelling correction models

**Mentors:** [Anindya Kundu](https://github.com/meganindya/)  
**Assisting Mentors:** [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender/), [Devin Ulibarri](https://github.com/pikurasa)  
**Reporting Period:** 2025-06-02 - 2025-06-08  

---

## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** Figure out the constants required for building the outline of the different brick SVGs.
- **Goal 2:** Find out formulae for creation of dynamic parts for the creation of the brick outlines.
- **Goal 3:** Creating functions for rendering different brick types given a set of parameters.

---

## This Week’s Achievements

1. **Identified core constants for SVG brick outlines**  
   - Analyzed existing functions to extract constants and segment lengths.
   - Documented fixed edge sizes and arc parameters required for rendering base brick structure. Here is the doc regarding the same - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AUlA2leDJIfV3ZXceLhCaITftExq6c5BcUBMZOtZBvE/edit?usp=sharing
2. **Derived dynamic formulae for brick segments**  
   - Broke down SVG path logic to understand variable-dependent segments (e.g., based on presence of notches or arguments).
   - Reverse-engineered svg paths into configurable logic blocks.

3. **Implemented param-based render logic for brick types**  
   - Created functions to output valid SVG paths.
   - Ensured functions deliver the correct kind of brick based on the parameters given to it. 

---

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Understanding how fixed and dynamic SVG path parts interac 
  **Solution:** Visually inspected path output, compared it to expected segments, and mapped patterns to conditional logic.

- **Challenge:** Ensuring proper rendering across all brick types
  **Solution:** Used example bricks for side-by-side validation; gradually modularized logic to support extensibility.

---

## Key Learnings

- Gained clarity on **brick geometry constants** and their significance in SVG construction.
- Improved ability to **translate SVG paths into conditional logic functions**.
- Strengthened understanding of **segment chaining**, **arc-to-curve translations**, and **parametric shape rendering**.

---

# Week 01 Progress Report by Shubham Singh

**Project:** [Color Sensor for Music Blocks](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/issues/4537)  
**Mentors:** [Devin Ulibarri](https://github.com/pikurasa), [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender)  
**Reporting Period:** 2025-06-01 - 2025-06-07

---

## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** Basic UI for Image Upload/Real time Video upload and adjust.
- **Goal 2:** Putting the developed UIs onto the widget blocks.
- **Goal 3:** Searching for exisiting audios in the phrase maker and note blocks.

---

## This Week’s Achievements

1. **Interface for Image upload for Lego Notations**  
   - Music Blocks has a feature to detect the color of pixels generated from drawing within the program, but it cannot detect the color of pixels from images that are either uploaded or from a webcam. 
   - By adding a feature to detect color from both uploaded images and a live webcam stream, users would be able to implement Lego music notation for the blind and similarly interactive programs.
   
   ![screenshot-description](https://i.ibb.co/d0yVXJmP/Lego-Bricks-Google-Chrome-08-06-2025-01-12-56.png)
   

2. **Live webcam feed and editing options**  
   - The following feature helps to use a real time video(webcam) onto the Lego Notation detection interface. Also, you may freely edit and move it around the canvas.
   ![screenshot-description](https://i.ibb.co/n8cswJsP/Lego-Bricks-Google-Chrome-08-06-2025-01-14-01.png)

   - Here's the reference video regarding lego bricks as musical notes:
   [youtube: LOfrCPf3XJU]

   - Here's Devin's CMK project for color sensor project in music blocks:
   [Reflections from constructing modern knowledge](https://medium.com/@sugarlabs/reflections-from-constructing-modern-knowledge-2024-1ce7d60fbb1c) 
    
3. **Identified methods to making a new widget block in music blocks**  
   - I read and went through a lot of documentation, searching for how we can add a new widget block in music blocks. I figured out a few flaws and how can the documentation be improved for future contributors.
   ![screenshot-description](https://i.ibb.co/bVD8Z54/image.png)
   - From what I've realized working on it, for adding a new block on the music blocks, I definitely think that for adding a new block, a lot of the code - UIs, features, etc. would already exist and you can just inherit those exisiting classes. And also, you'll have to edit and change a LOT of files and add new methods for your own new block.
    ![screenshot-description](https://i.ibb.co/hJRKV0Vq/Documentation.png)

---

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Getting started on features and UIs with a lot of doubts about how it should look like.
- **Solution:** Consulting my mentors, presenting variations of "How it could be" to them, refering to EXISTING UIs in Music Blocks.

---

## Key Learnings

- Gained familiarity with **making new blocks**.
- Deepened understanding of **inheritance and code modularity**
- Improved skills in **exports, imports, code reusability**, **documentation**, and **collaboration workflows**.

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Implement **mapping of musical notes to lego bricks' colors**.
- Refine **UIs** based on mentor feedback.
- Inherit the exisiting code inside **WidgetBlocks.js** code as UI.
- Target: Completing the **core implementation** in the week number 2 and 3.

---

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to some old pull requests and documentation available in music blocks, I was able to figure out on a lot about how new blocks are created on the music blocks interface. Will definitely add on more.

## Introduction & About Me
Hey, I'm Mebin 👋🏻! I'm a first year student at PES University, Bangalore, India, currently pursuing a BTech in Computer Science. I’ve had a deep passion for tech ever since I was 10, when I first learned in a CS class that you could write a couple of lines of code and build a (barely functional) website. That simple idea sparked something in me, and over the years, my love for computer science has only grown—especially while building a bunch of cool things along the way.

About a month ago, I launched my personal portfolio website: [mebin.in](https://mebin.in/). It runs on an 8-year-old Raspberry Pi sitting at home 🤩, so apologies in advance if the site is occasionally slow or down (power cuts are a real pain). I'll be posting a copy of these blogs there as well. Go check 'em out and a bunch of other blogs I've written there!

I'm also building a Bluesky client in the Nim programming language. I'm a strong advocate for education in technology. In the past, I built a web application aimed at connecting students in rural areas with those in urban areas to help foster a free and open peer-to-peer learning ecosystem.

To say that I’m thrilled to be working on the Speak Activity would be an understatement. I can’t wait for an amazing summer filled with learning, collaboration and helping enhance educational journey for millions of learners world-wide.

---

## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** Benchmark and test various models and architectures.
- **Goal 2:** Evaluate the feasibility and implementation approach based on project constraints such as hardware limitations and size requirements.

---

## This Week’s Achievements

1. **Created a Streamlit benchmark app**  
   - A simple streamlit app was made to compare responses of different Large Language Models (LLMs) & Small Language Models (SLMs). This was done to understand which models were a good fit for our requirements.
   - Links: [Streamlit App](https://llm-benchmarking-sugar.streamlit.app/), [GitHub](https://github.com/mebinthattil/LLM-benchmarking).


---

## Selection Of Models and Challenges

- The selection of the LLM was fairly easy, as all the models in the 30-ish billion parameter range performed reasonably well without any fine-tuning. These models were _smart_ but required significant resources to run. That was fine, since the model was intended to be hosted on AWS and accessed via an API endpoint managed by Sugar-AI.
- The selection of the SLM was a bit tricky. Initially, we looked at models under 1B parameters like the Qwen3-0.6B, and the responses were hilariously bad as expected. Later, I experimented with a dual-model architecture, where one model would generate the answer and another model (or the same model with a different system prompt) would refine the answer. I tried this with the Gemma3-1B model as the generating model and the same Gemma3-1B(with a different system prompt), as the evaluation/refinement model. The results were surprisingly good! This model generated answers that were up there with the 30B parameter models! The only caveat is that it technically takes twice the time for inference, but considering the model is pretty small, it wasn’t too bad.
- That said, Gemma3-1B Instruct even after 4-bit quantization is still around 1GB in size, which is much more than we can package with the Speak activity. So now I’m going to be looking into even lighter models like TinyBERT and will update the benchmarks soon.
- Fine-tuning in the next step should hopefully improve the performance of these models as well. Considering that we also need to package the TTS model, we really need to make sure the SLM is as lightweight as possible.

**TLDR:**  
LLM selection was easy — they all perform pretty well. SLM poses some challenges. Dual-model (generation + evaluation/refinement) seems to produce much better responses. Size of the SLM needs to be reduced further (hopefully under 100MB).

  

---

## Key Learnings

- Dual model architecture (generation model + evaluation/refinement model) produces some great results, even if the individual models are very small or perform bad individually!

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Setup AWS for fine-tuning the model.
- Finalize on the model to go forward with.
- Finalize on the dataset to start fine-tuning SLM with.
- Include much smaller models like TinyBert in the benchmark.
- Start fine-tuning TinyBert or any other SLM on the agreed upon dataset in the hopes to improve performance.

4. **Structured Clean Codebase for Scalability**
   - Organized backend into proper folders: \`controllers\`, \`services\`, \`utils\`, \`routes\`, \`config\`, and \`types\`.
   - Made the repo production-ready with readable service-based architecture.
   - Check the project at [Link](https://github.com/benikk/musicblocks-backend)

5. **Optimized Token Management & Project Creation**
   - Validated rate limits (15,000 requests/hour for GitHub App installation tokens).
   - Each request generates a fresh installation token, no collisions or race conditions observed so far.


---

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Writing multiple files to a new GitHub repository using Octokit caused noticeable delays
- **Solution:** Batched file uploads with asynchronous control using a loop and base64-encoded content, I plan to imrove it
  by exploring GitHub’s Create a tree and commit API to upload multiple files in a single commit for performance optimization.

---

## Key Learnings

- Deep understanding of GitHub App authentication using JWT + installation tokens.  
- Secure project ownership enforcement using hashing and metadata tracking.  
- Octokit’s repo/file handling APIs and best practices for GitHub integrations.  

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

-  Add **edit project** functionality: Only owner (with original key) can update content.  
-  Implement **key-based ownership check middleware** to protect sensitive routes.  
-  Allow users to **open GitHub issues** on created repositories via the backend.

# Week 1 Progress Report by Safwan Sayeed

**Project:** Music Blocks 4 Program Engine  
**Mentors:** [Anindya Kundu](https://github.com/meganindya/), [Sumit Srivastava](https://github.com/sum2it)  
**Assisting Mentors:** [Devin Ullibari](https://github.com/pikurasa/), [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender)  
**Reporting Period:** 2025-06-02 - 2025-06-08

## A Blog-style Retrospective

Last week marked the official start of the coding phase for the Music Blocks 4 Program Engine. I spent the first few days translating our planning sessions into a concrete technical specification. Crafting the spec helped me clarify the core constructs, their key properties, and how they will map to interfaces. The early draft already feels like a solid roadmap for the engine’s evolution.

Midweek, I teamed up with Karan Palan to begin coding the skeleton of our abstract classes. We paired on Replit to code the classes. 

---

## Goals for This Week

- Draft a comprehensive tech spec detailing engine constructs, class interfaces, and example workflows.  
- Implement the initial set of abstract classes in TypeScript.  
- Outline AST build steps and prepare a simple program example.

---

## This Week’s Highlights

1. **Tech Specification Draft**  
   - Wrote the first section of the tech spec covering .  
   - Link: [Tech Spec Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_MCCgl-RqiEQH0UQ4EX-2O6G4iRxgHAY1rZpw3QPXT0/edit?tab=t.otbw6ldsc32w)

2. **Abstract Classes Implementation**  
   - Started coding the core abstract classes in TypeScript alongside [Karan Palan](https://github.com/Karan-Palan).  
   - Link: [Replit: Engine Abstract Classes](https://replit.com/@karanpalan007/engine-abstract-classes?v=1#README.md)

3. **AST Discussion & Planning**  
   - Held discussions with Anindya on AST constructs, class instantiation workflow, and example program build.  
   - Outlined next steps for documenting AST examples in the tech spec.

---

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Syncing Edits on Replit:**  
  We initially clashed on file versioning.  
  *Solution:* Established a clear editing schedule and used commit comments to track changes.

- **Defining Spec Scope:**  
  The broad set of music constructs felt overwhelming.  
  *Solution:* Prioritized a core subset to include in the first draft.

---

## Key Learnings

- Mastered TypeScript abstract classes and interface patterns.  
- Reinforced the importance of early design documentation.  
- Gained clarity on AST building workflows through Anindya's feedback.

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Finalize abstract class implementations and interfaces.  
- Expand the spec with AST examples and UML class diagrams if needed.

# Week 01 Progress Report by Saumya Shahi

**Project:** [Masonry Module - Music Blocks v4](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks-v4)  
**Mentors:** [Anindya Kundu](https://github.com/meganindya/)  
**Assisting Mentors:** [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender/), [Devin Ulibarri](https://github.com/pikurasa/)  
**Reporting Period:** 2025-06-01 - 2025-06-08

---

## Goals for This Week

- Understand the working of SVGs and path rendering logic.
- Create an exhaustive list of all configurations needed to render each visual brick type.
- Formulate the path rendering logic to dynamically generate each brick.
- Implement rendering logic for SVG bricks based on the provided configurations.
- Ensure each brick type renders correctly with various parameters.

---

## This Week’s Achievements

1. **Explored SVG-based Brick Rendering**  
   - Used [SVG Playground](https://yqnn.github.io/svg-path-editor/) to manually draw and style bricks.  
   - This helped me understand SVG path syntax, positioning, scaling, and how \`viewBox\` works for consistent rendering.  
   - Also referred to the [MDN SVG Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorials/SVG_from_scratch/Getting_started) for deeper insights into SVG internals.

2. **Compiled a Comprehensive List of Brick Types**  
   - Created a detailed list of all visually distinct brick types to be supported by the Masonry module.  
   - This helped identify variation across different bricks and how they interact in Music Blocks.  
   - [Brick Types Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BswWHadyy4yC3_3vK6KHZnMn0u6jbbYiQ6JQWiqRMLw/edit?tab=t.0)

3. **Mapped Configurations for Each Brick Type**  
   - Listed out all the necessary configurations (similar to React props) for each brick — including label size, number of arguments, shape flags, etc.  
   - This configuration map allows dynamic rendering logic per brick type.  
   - [Configurations Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UJXh3734S138BoTsGulzeTlZXstyvWd6syJK2eclMKI/edit?usp=sharing)

4. **Implemented SVG Brick Rendering**  
   - Successfully implemented dynamic SVG rendering logic.  
   - Given a configuration, each brick now generates an accurate path representation.  
   - The system supports variation in label length, slot types, and layout, making the rendering pipeline fully flexible.

---

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Brick structures vary significantly, making a one-size-fits-all rendering approach difficult.  
  **Solution:** Broke down commonalities across bricks and created modular rendering components that dynamically adapt based on type and config.

- **Challenge:** Path distortion with varying argument lengths and labels.  
  **Solution:** Used live preview tools and console-based debugging to isolate scaling issues. The SVG path editor was extremely useful in this phase.

---

## Key Learnings

- Gained strong understanding of **SVG path syntax** and dynamic drawing.
- Improved in building **config-driven rendering pipelines** with a clean separation of data and UI logic.
- Learned how to break down complex visual requirements into **reusable, parameterized components**.
- Realized that **explaining your thought process to mentors** is invaluable — it clarifies confusion and leads to better solutions.

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Work on edge cases and introduce early validation of config inputs.
- Build a **basic layout logic**  that dynamically generates a SVGs for a tree of bricks (Multiple bricks rendering).
- Begin implementing **connection logic** based on bounding box / collision detection.

**Reporting Period:** 2025-06-01 - 2025-06-07  

---

## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** Refine prompt templates and instructions for the LLM.
- **Goal 2:** Host the project on Streamlit Cloud.
- **Goal 3:** Develop Fast API endpoints.
- **Goal 4:** Find an alternative cloud-based vector database.

---

## This Week’s Achievements

1. **Fast API Endpoints**  
   - Although I kept this task later in my proposal but it became necessary when I wanted to deploy the project for testing purposes. The endpoints /chat and /summary are used by the client-side app when having a conversation with the user. It is working perfectly in my local development environment, but it caused an issue when I tried to host the Fast API server on [Render](https://render.com/). After several trials, I found that the embedding model I am using - 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' is a bit heavy, and the RAM usage given by the free service is not enough.
   But anyway, this is a success as we will need Fast API during the final deployment.


2. **Cloud based vector database - Qdrant**  
   - For development, I have been using ChromaDB, which is pretty good for testing and developing RAG applications locally. I have now opted to use Qdrant, which provides cloud-based vector database. It is working well with the Streamlit app.
   - [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/)

3. **Hosted Streamlit App**  
   - Because the Fast API server was not deployed, I simply wrote the RAG code in the Streamlit code itself. Now that it is hosted, mentors and contributors can test it and give feedback.
   - [Streamlit app](https://reflectionapp-2yoxtvn6sknvktme2zorvq.streamlit.app/)

4. **Refined Prompts**
   - Prompt Engineering is the key to get a well structured and quality response from any LLM. I improved the instructions for the LLM to ask follow up questions to get quality answers from users.

---

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Fast API deployment fails.  
  **Solution:** The overall goal was to deploy the project so that mentors can test it and give me feedback for the summer period. Therefore, I modified the streamlit code to handle the RAG application by itself. Hence, I tackled the problem by avoiding server deployment.

---

## Key Learnings

- I learned new technologies: Fast API and Streamlit. I watched tutorials on YouTube and read their documentations as well. 
- Learned how API endpoints work and how to manage API keys while deploying it.

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Work on things suggested by mentors.
- Improve the analysis phase. This phase of the reflection learning cycle is suppose to compare and contrast user development over a period of time. Currently it uses a hardcoded summary but it needs to be dynamic.
- Write documentation for Music Blocks. Some topics still needs to get covered.

## Introduction & About Me

Hey everyone! This is probably going to be my biggest blog post of the GSoC journey haha — and I'm excited to share my thoughts on the GTK4 migration project during the community bonding period and some work done till the first week. I will just give a short introduction—

I'm Krish Pandya aka MostlyK, a B.Tech student in Electronics and Communication Engineering at IIITH. While my degree says ECE, I've found myself gravitating toward robotics, graphics, software , and most imporatant of them all open source development. When I'm not debugging ~~C++~~ (Rust/Python now) code or setting up new linux systems, you'll find me reading philosophy (currently juggling reading Sartre's Nausea and Red Rising), creating music, or tinkering with RISC-V processors. I believe in doing things properly , whether it's writing neat code, understanding the philosophy behind API changes, or setting up development workflows that actually make sense. And writing stuff so coming back , anyone can just give a glance and thank me for writing this, I know my future self is going to read this a lot!

The Sugar desktop environment currently relies on GTK3, which is approaching end-of-life. My mission? Modernize Sugar by completing its migration to GTK4, ensuring long-term sustainability, improved performance, and access to modern UI features. This involves porting the core toolkit (sugar-toolkit-gtk3), porting an activity to GTK4 and making a new activity along with the new features that will be added and testing the changes.

---

## My Approach & Tooling Setup

Before diving into the actual porting work, I spent considerable time setting up an efficient development workflow. Coming from other projects, I knew that having quick way to test my changes, that is currently I just have to build the toolkit first but later on testing , it helps to have a faster way to test stuff, I may even bring out some tmux scripts later down the weeks but as of now the following is enough:

### Development Scripts That Saved My Sanity

I created a couple of shell snippets that became essential during this period:

\`\`\`bash
# Replace system sugar3 with development version
# This ensures activities use the modified toolkit instead of the old system version
sudo rm -rf /usr/lib/python3.13/site-packages/sugar3;sudo cp -r ./src/sugar3 /usr/lib/python3.13/site-packages/sugar3

# Complete rebuild and install cycle
sudo ./autogen.sh;sudo make clean;sudo make;sudo make install
\`\`\`

The first script is particularly crucial - it replaces the system's sugar3 package with my development version. Without this, Sugar activities would continue using the old GTK3 toolkit, making it impossible to test the GTK4 migration properly. The second command handles the full build cycle, all these small changes help a lot in the long run. I also knew that because I had to write a lot, I developed my own espanso setup and added stuff like em dashes , en dashes, some template code, and a bunch of stuff that come useful while writing.

### The Work Begins

1. **Started with the obvious**: Updated all \`gi.require_version\` calls from GTK 3.0 to 4.0
2. **Build system updates**: Modified GIR includes to use Gtk-4.0 and Gdk-4.0
3. **The part to work around**: Dealing with GTK4's opaque structures and API changes

---

## The Challenges & My Thought Process

### 1: GdkEvent Becomes Opaque

This was my first real "welcome to GTK4" moment. In GTK3, you could directly access event fields like \`event->type\` or \`event->grab_broken.keyboard\`. GTK4 said "nope!" and made GdkEvent structures completely opaque.

**My approach:**
- Systematically went through each event controller file
- Replaced direct field access with proper accessor functions
- \`event->type\` became \`gdk_event_get_event_type()\`
- \`event->touch.x/y\` became \`gdk_event_get_position(event, &x, &y)\`

**The human moment:** I'll be honest, this felt tedious at first. But then I realized GTK4's approach actually makes the code more maintainable and future-proof. The accessor functions provide better type safety and clearer intent.

### 2: GDK_GRAB_BROKEN Disappears

The \`GDK_GRAB_BROKEN\` event type just... vanished. After diving into GTK4 documentation, I learned that GTK4 handles grab management automatically now.

**Solution:** Removed the grab broken handling entirely. Well I am not sure if that's a good choice , let's see what happens next week, if we have to come here!
### 3: Goodbye GdkPoint, Hello Custom Structures

GTK4 removed the \`GdkPoint\` structure that Sugar was using. So naturally, I created a custom \`SugarPoint\` structure:

\`\`\`c
typedef struct {
    double x;
    double y;
} SugarPoint;
\`\`\`

**The learning:** Sometimes migration isn't just about updating APIs, it's about understanding when to create your own abstractions.

---

## Current Progress Snapshot

Here's where things stand after the community bonding period:

### Completed
- Updated all \`gi.require_version\` calls to 4.0 in Python files
- Updated import statements across the codebase
- Fixed build system GIR includes (Gtk-4.0, Gdk-4.0)
- **Fixed GdkEvent opaque struct access** in sugar-event-controller.c
- **Migrated all event controllers** to GTK 4 event handling
- **Created and implemented SugarPoint** structure to replace GdkPoint

### In Progress
- Hunting down remaining 3.0 version references (they're sneaky!)
- Fixing eggaccelerator errors (legacy code is fun, right?)

### Next on the Roadmap
- Replace GtkToolbar with GtkBox
- Migrate GtkEventBox to GtkWidget + EventControllers
- Update GtkContainer usage to new child management APIs
- Convert draw() methods to snapshot()
- Update size request/allocation APIs

---

## Key Learnings & Insights

This period taught me that migration projects are as much about understanding the philosophy behind changes as they are about updating code. GTK4 isn't just GTK3 with new version numbers,  it represents this shift toward:

- Better memory safety with opaque structures
- Cleaner event handling with dedicated controllers
- Modern rendering with the snapshot model

 The most valuable skill I've developed is learning to read the porting doc, and understand where to add my own implementation or follow the documentation. I try to reason my changes, so most of the time I am trying to argue to myself why this change compared to something else.

# Week 01 Progress Report by Om Santosh Suneri

**Project:** [AI-powered Debugger for Music Blocks](https://github.com/omsuneri/AI-powered-Debugger-for-Music-Blocks)  
**Mentors:** [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender/) [Sumit Srivastava](https://github.com/sum2it)  
**Assisting Mentors:** [Devin Ulibarri](https://github.com/pikurasa/)  
**Reporting Period:** 2025-06-02 - 2025-06-07  

---

## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** To refine the JSON to text convertor code.
- **Goal 2:** To convert the convertor's Javascript code to Python.
- **Goal 3:** To create a basic Streamlit debugger app UI.

---

## This Week’s Achievements

1. **JSON to Text Converter Refinement**  
   - I focused on refining the JSON to Text Converter for Music Blocks. I improved the metadata representation of the "start" block to make it more accurate and readable in the text format. Additionally, I added support for more block types, ensuring that their text representations are consistent with the design format.
   - This refinement is important because the JSON to Text Converter is a core part of our AI-powered Debugger. A clear and structured text format makes it easier for both the AI model and human users to understand the program logic.

2. **Javascript to Python Conversion**  
   - Following suggestions from mentors Walter and Devin, I began creating a Streamlit-based debugger interface. Since Streamlit is a Python framework, my first step was to convert the existing JSON to Text Converter—originally written in JavaScript—into Python. This involved translating the logic and formatting rules to ensure the output remained consistent.
   - This conversion is crucial because it enables seamless integration of the converter into the Streamlit app, which will serve as the initial interface for our debugger. By moving the code to Python, I ensured compatibility with the app’s backend, allowing further development like live user queries, debugging and feedback—all in one cohesive Python environment.

3. **Streamlit Debugger App UI Creation**  
   - As a beginner to Streamlit, I started building the UI for the debugger app. I successfully created a basic Streamlit interface that allows users to input text queries. To handle these queries, I integrated the free Google Gemini API, enabling the app to return LLM-generated responses. Currently, the app supports simple user input and displays the corresponding Gemini response.
   - This is an important first step in building an interactive AI-powered debugger. Even though it’s still in an early stage, this app lays the foundation for integrating core features like JSON-to-text conversion, error analysis, and user feedback. The goal is to evolve this into a fully functional debugging tool that enhances the Music Blocks experience.

---

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Learning the Streamlit framework and creating a basic UI app as a complete beginner.  
  **Solution:** To overcome this, I referred to the official Streamlit documentation, followed beginner tutorials, and experimented with small components to understand the structure. This hands-on approach helped me build a working basic UI that takes user input and integrates it with the Gemini API.

- **Challenge:** Converting all methods and functions from JavaScript to Python was time-consuming and introduced several errors.  
  **Solution:** I carefully mapped the logic from JavaScript to Python, using Pythonic alternatives where necessary. I used print-based debugging and Python’s error messages to identify issues. Although some minor bugs remain, I have a clear plan to fix them in the coming days and will be testing each function thoroughly for accurate output.

---

## Key Learnings

- I gained an understanding of Streamlit’s basic architecture and learned how to build and deploy a Streamlit app
- I explored advanced Python techniques to effectively translate the JavaScript code into Python for smoother integration.

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- My goal for the next week is to fully convert the JSON to Text Converter, originally written in JavaScript, into Python. 
- I also plan to integrate this Python version directly into the Streamlit debugger app to enable seamless JSON conversion within the app interface. 
- Additionally, I aim to make the basic functionality of the app usable so that users can begin interacting with it and provide initial feedback. This feedback will help identify usability issues early and guide further improvements in the UI and debugging workflow.

## Progress

I am excited to announce that I have been selected for Sugar Summer of Code 2025. This summer I would be working on creating a Generative AI tool that would create endless sound samples that can be then used in Music Blocks.

This week I kicked off my project, I had a meeting with my mentors, and discussed my approach with them. For the next week, it was decided to create a basic frontend using streamlit and for the backend will be using [MusicGen](https://audiocraft.metademolab.com/musicgen.html).

I will begin by testing some prompts and generating some samples from it, to test whether they can be used in Music Blocks or further refinement of the pipeline is needed.

# Community Bonding + Week 1 Progress Report

**by Karan Palan**

**Projects:** Music Blocks 4 **Masonry** & **Program Engine**  
**Role:** Volunteer & Peer-Mentor (GSoC 2024 alumnus)  
**Mentor:** [Anindya Kundu](https://github.com/meganindya/)  
**Mentees:** [Justin Charles](https://github.com/justin212407), [Saumya Shahi](https://github.com/saumyashahi) (Masonry) • [Safwan Sayeed](https://github.com/sa-fw-an) (Engine)  
**Reporting Period:** 2025-05-20 → 2025-06-08  

---

Community bonding this year felt less like “hello world” and more like an accelerated CS grad course. Anindya flipped the script: before writing a single line of code we dissected *how* languages work, explored compiler pipelines, and compared micro-compilers.

### Mapping Bricks to LLVM IR

Armed with that theory, each of us reverse-mapped **Music Blocks bricks → LLVM intermediate representation** to ground our designs in real compiler constructs. My early spreadsheet of brick vs. IR became a north star for future optimizations.

### Defining Music Blocks Grammar

After digesting JavaScript’s formal grammar, we drafted a Music Blocks-specific one that is lean, kid-friendly, but still transpilable to JS. This fed directly into the Engine tech spec.

### Meeting with Andres

Anindya set up a fireside chat with his former manager **Andrés**, giving us a crash-course in real-world engineering. Andrés drilled home that *“quick fixes live for 18 months,”* scope must be ruthlessly trimmed, and the true mark of a pro is writing code a stranger can maintain five years later, all while treating teammates (coders or not) with respect.

### Two Tracks, One Vision

We split weekly calls:

| Track   | Focus                           | Key Doc                                                                                                    |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Masonry | SVG brick generation & formulae | [Brick Sides & Formulae](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AUlA2leDJIfV3ZXceLhCaITftExq6c5BcUBMZOtZBvE/) |
| Engine  | AST, runtime, class hierarchy   | [Engine Tech Spec + AST](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_MCCgl-RqiEQH0UQ4EX-2O6G4iRxgHAY1rZpw3QPXT0/) |

---

## Highlights So Far

1. **Project-wide Knowledge Base**
   *Spreadsheet* of compiler concepts & Music Blocks parallels—anchors every design choice.
   Link ➜ [Mentor Context Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LFuIlzRiMlEfeLr21x8_SYnVIQ5baVQv8tz2GWN9PfU/)

2. **Brick Taxonomy Drafted**
   Classified each brick against LLVM constructs for easy reasoning about side-effects and type constraints.
   Link ➜ [Brick ↔️ LLVM Mapping](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BswWHadyy4yC3_3vK6KHZnMn0u6jbbYiQ6JQWiqRMLw/)

3. **Brick Geometry Formulae**
   With Justin & Saumya, derived parametric equations for every brick edge—vital for responsive SVG.
   Link ➜ [Brick Formulae Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AUlA2leDJIfV3ZXceLhCaITftExq6c5BcUBMZOtZBvE/)

4. **Engine Class Skeleton**
   Safwan and I scaffolded core *abstract* and initial *concrete* classes in TypeScript.
   Code ➜ [Replit Workspace](https://replit.com/@karanpalan007/engine-abstract-classes?v=1)



## Key Learnings

* **Teach, then build:** A solid mental model of compilers made later coding decisions friction-less.
* **Visual specs pay off:** Equation-driven SVG means less pixel-pushing, more deterministic rendering.
* **Peer-mentoring ≠ lecturing:** Guiding Justin, Saumya, and Safwan taught me to ask leading questions instead of prescribing answers.

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

* **Masonry:** Finish implementing '_generateLeft()' so *all* brick types respect left-side notches.
* **Engine:** Flesh out 'Expression' subclasses and prototype a minimal AST → JS transpile step.
* **Docs & CI:** Auto-publish rendered SVG examples in PR previews to catch geometry regressions early.

## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** Add a model selection palette UI to toggle between models.  
- **Goal 2:** Integrate the Human-body model into the paint activity and set the Human-body human model as the default view.  
- **Goal 3:** Refactor and improve naming conventions for bones in the skeleton model.  
- **Goal 4:** Localize the Human Body Activity using i18next.js, supporting English and French.  


---

## This Week’s Achievements

1. **Model Palette Implementation**  
    - Developed a new model selection palette in the UI allowing users to switch between:
        - Human body
        - Skeleton
        - Organs 
    - Set the Human body as the default model loaded on activity start.
    - Palette updates the 3D scene dynamically without requiring a full reload.
           ![screenshot-description](https://i.ibb.co/SDSYFJf7/image.png)   


2. **Human-Body Model Paint Integration**  
    - Integrated the Human body model with the interactive paint activity.  
    - Ensured hierarchical structure for smooth interactivity and logical mesh grouping  
        ![screenshot-description](https://i.ibb.co/4wqNymfG/image.png)   


3. **Improved Bone Naming in Skeleton Model**  
    - Refactored the skeletal model for accurate and educational naming:
        - Replaced generic labels like “Lower Leg” with specific names like **Tibia** and **Fibula**.
        - Split forearm into **Radius** and **Ulna**, adjusting geometry and mesh positions.



4. **Implemented i18next.js to support internationalization.**  
    - Implemented **i18next.js** to support internationalization.
    - Completed full translation of Human Body Activity in **English** and **French**.  
    - Translation files follow standard .json structure for easy future expansion.  
    - Example image for French:
        ![screenshot-description](https://i.ibb.co/99ggYBDj/image.png)   


---

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Naming skeleton bones accurately without anatomical overlap.  
  **Solution:** Cross-referenced medical diagrams and validated model mesh mapping manually in Blender.

---

## Key Learnings

- Deepened understanding of scene management in Three.js and optimized mesh rendering for performance.  
- Gained experience in internationalization using i18next.js  
- Developed more precise anatomical terminology awareness and importance of educational clarity.

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Write Weekly Blog Post summarizing progress, screenshots, and key learnings.   
- Fix Organs model. Distance between eyes and mouth seems to be more than required, reduce that and see if there is some alignment issue.   
- Integrate the full human body model into the paint activity to allow direct interaction and labeling across complete anatomy.   
- Merge Paint and Learn mode to show a popup at bottom of screen when user click a part

## Goals for This Week

- **Goal:** Complete and deploy code to blocks functionality with full documentation and begin work on debugger.

---

## This Week’s Achievements

**Added All Blocks for Code to Blocks Support**  

I added all blocks that are supported for block to code conversion to be supported for code to blocks conversion. I also added all necessary unit tests, and very [detailed documentation](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/blob/master/js/js-export/CONVERSION_GUIDE.md) on how to add new blocks for support.

**Optimized Files**

I added a script to minify the JSON config so that musicblocks doesn't need to load the entire large file. I also merged many blocks that have the same path in the AST so that the config looks cleaner, and adding new blocks of the same path is even easier.

**Deployed Project**

The code to blocks project has been complete and deployed, as seen in this [merged PR](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/pull/4707). To test, simply write your musicblocks program in Javascript in the editor and press the convert button. Note that the only blocks supported are those supported by block to code conversion, so it won't work on every single block possible, but will work on most of them.

---

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Minimizing file size of config file

  **Solution:** Merging configs, and using minified JSON for loading.

- **Challenge:** Never-seen-before git errors when trying to push commit

  **Solution:** Image size as part of the documentation was too large, had to compress it.

---

## Key Learnings

- Deepened understanding of git.
- Improved skills in **debugging**, **code design**, and **collaboration workflows**.

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Begin debugger project
- Being able to set breakpoints in the code
- Add ability to trigger status block in the code as the debugger

---

## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** Setup AWS for Fine-Tuning.
- **Goal 2:** Fine-Tune a small model on a small dataset.
- **Goal 3:** Deploy the model on AWS and create an API endpoint.
- **Goal 4:** Test the endpoint using a python script.
- **Goal 5:** Evaluate the model responses and think about next steps.

---

## This Week’s Achievements

1. **Setup AWS for Fine-Tuning**  
   - Setup AWS SageMaker.
   - Provisioned GPUs on AWS SageMaker to fine-tune Llama3-1B foundation model.
    
2. **Dataset & Cleaning**
   - Used an open dataset. It was a dataset about conversations between a student and a teacher.
   - The dataset was cleaned and converted into a format that Llama needed for fine-tuning.
   - Wrote a small script to convert the dataset into a format that Llama can understand.
   - The dataset along with the script is available [here](https://github.com/mebinthattil/Education-Dialogue-Dataset).

3. **Fine-tuning**
   - Fine-tuned the model on a small set of the dataset, just to see how it performs and to get familar with AWS SageMaker.
   - The training job ran on a \`ml.g5.2xlarge\` instance.
   - The hyperparameters that were set so as to reduce memory footprint and mainly to test things. I'll list the hyperparameters, hoping this would serve as documentation for future fine-tuning.
   
   **Hyperparameters**:

4. **Saving the model**
    - The safetensors and other model files were saved in an AWS S3 bucket. The URI of the bucket is: \`\`\` s3://sagemaker-ap-south-1-021891580293/jumpstart-run2/output/model/ \`\`\`

5. **Deploying the model**
    - The model was deployed on AWS SageMaker and an API endpoint was created.

6. **Testing the model**
    - A python script was written to test the model using the API endpoint.
  
7. **Evaluation**
    - The model responses were tested using the same questions used in my [benchmark](https://llm-benchmarking-sugar.streamlit.app/) done before.
  

---

## Unexpected Model Output

- After fine-tuning the model, I noticed that the model was producing some unexpected output. I expected the model to behave like general chatbot but in a more friendly and teacher-like manner. While the model's responses did sound like a teacher, the model would often try to create an entire chain of conversations generating the next response from a students perspective and then proceeed to answer itself.
- This behaviour was becaues of the way the dataset was strucutred. The dataset was enssentially a list of back and forth conversations between a student and a teacher. So it makes sense that the model would try to create a chain of conversations. But this is not what we need from the model. 
- The next step is to change the strucutre of the dataset to make it just answer questions, but also to make it more conversational and understand the nuaces of a chain of conversations.
- The temporary fix was the add a stop statement while generating responses and also tweaking the system prompt. But again, this is not the right way to go about it. The right was is to change the dataset structure.

---

## Sample model output with stop condition

![sample model output](https://mebin.shop/Mebin-test-FT-model-tesponses.png)

---

## Key Learnings

- Structure of dataset needs to be changed, in order to make it more conversational and understand the nuances of a chain of conversations.
  
---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Re-structure the dataset
- Re-Train and Fine-Tunethe model on the new dataset
- Deploy, create endpoint and test the model on the new dataset
- Evaluate the model on the new dataset and add to benchmarks

**Mentors:** [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender), [Ibiam Chihurumnaya Ibiam](https://github.com/chimosky), [Juan Pablo Ugarte](https://github.com/xjuan)       
**Reporting Period:** June 06, 2025 till June 14, 2025

## The Meeting that changed everything

On Friday(06-06-2025), we had a pivotal video call with Juan Pablo Ugarte and Ibiam Chihurumnaya that completely reshaped the porting approach.
What started as a discussion about my initial porting work evolved into something much more strategic and forward-thinking.

> While the time of writing this, another meet that happened on 13-06-2025 , we discussed about the API versioning and updating with pytest, ideas about testing, more porting golden advice, more about this on next week's blog.

### The New Architecture Vision

The mentors introduced a brilliant modular approach that addresses the core challenges of the GTK4 migration:

**1. Two Separate Libraries Strategy**
- C Library 'sugar-ext': Core objects and reusable GTK widgets
- Python Wrapper Library: Python widgets and wrapper functions

![GTK4 Planning](assets/Images/gtk4drawing.png)

> Subject to change

**2. Independent Development & Testing**
Each library will be developed in its own repository with simple Python example scripts. This approach offers several advantages:
- Clear separation of concerns between C and Python components
- Easier debugging and testing
- Better CI/CD pipeline management
- Modular, incremental development that reduces complexity

**3. Meson Build System Foundation**
We'll use Meson's shared library template from GNOME Builder as our base. This gives us:
- Modern build system designed for GTK4
- Better dependency management
- Cleaner project structure

### Why This Approach Made Sense

The more I thought about this strategy, the more I realized how elegant it is. Instead of trying to port everything at once (my initial approach, by changing the orignal toolkit and it's systems), we're building a solid foundation that can support the entire Sugar ecosystem. This modular approach means:

- Maintainability — Each component can be updated independently
- Testing — Smaller, focused libraries are easier to test thoroughly
- Future-proofing — The architecture can adapt as GTK continues to evolve
- Support — Due to the new build system, we would have more support and we can also remove things we find deprecated.
---

## Implementation

Following the meeting  – I immediately got to work implementing. 
The result that came out was [Pull Request #1](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-ext/pull/1) in the new 'sugar-ext' repository.

### What I Built

**Project Structure:**
- Complete Meson build system setup
- GObject Introspection integration for seamless Python bindings
- Initial API implementation (starting with XO Colors for testing)
- Comprehensive documentation and development tools

**Key Technical Decisions:**
\`\`\`c
// API versioning strategy
api_version = '1.0'     // Maintaining compatibility with existing SugarExt
package_version = '0.122.0'  // Following Sugar's versioning convention

// GIR configuration for Python bindings
symbol_prefix: 'sugarext'
identifier_prefix: 'SugarExt'
\`\`\`

> This was discussed later in the meet and we decided to keep the packages version 2.0 or 4.0 because GTK4. Will be confirmed by the next blog,

- Included comprehensive build and test scripts

### Testing Framework

The project includes a robust testing setup:
\`\`\`bash
meson test -C builddir
\`\`\`

This runs the test suite, validating that the C library builds correctly and the test written should pass.

## Lessons from the PR Review Process

- To be added on week 3 as it gets merged!


# Migration List 

- Here Use as-is means if we decide to keep it we use it or it's newer version or alternatives. Port meaning we would have to change stuff, and whenever I have mentioned GTK4 we will use the new API directly rather than implementing from scratch.

# Week 02 Progress Report by Saumya Shahi

**Project:** [Masonry Module - Music Blocks v4](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks-v4)  
**Mentors:** [Anindya Kundu](https://github.com/meganindya/)  
**Assisting Mentors:** [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender), [Devin Ulibarri](https://github.com/pikurasa)  
**Reporting Period:** 2025-06-08 – 2025-06-14  

---

## Goals for This Week

- Refine and complete configuration-driven rendering logic.
- Test rendering of multiple brick types and validate correctness using sample input.
- Document how brick configurations and connections should be modeled.
- Start building foundational elements for brick tree rendering.

---

## This Week's Achievements

1. **Dynamic SVG Brick Rendering**  
   - Finalized implementation for rendering SVG paths dynamically based on type-specific configurations.  
   - Different bricks (e.g., nested bricks, simple bricks, expression bricks) now render accurately according to their label sizes, scale, and other config props.  
   - Output adjusts responsively with different numbers of arguments, notches, and labels.

2. **Rendered Output Validation & Screenshots**  
   - Verified each visual brick against expected path geometry.  
   - Screenshots below show rendered bricks:
        ![Simple Brick](/assets/Images/simple-bricks.png)
        ![Brick with Arguments](/assets/Images/expression-bricks.png)
        ![Nested Brick](/assets/Images/nested-bricks.png)

2. **Bug Fix: Left SVG Path Issue**

   * Fixed a critical error in path rendering for bricks — the left edge generation wasn’t calculating offsets correctly.
   * Cleaned up related path logic to improve readability and scalability for future nested structures.

3. **Storybook & Testing Familiarization**

   * Understood how Storybook is used for visual component testing.
   * Learnt how to set up unit tests and component test files.
   * Setup groundwork for adding future test cases.

---

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Mapping the brick tree vs AST was initially confusing.
**Solution:** Spent focused time breaking down what each structure is supposed to represent and clarified use cases.

- **Challenge:** SVG left path errors were hard to trace visually.
**Solution:** Used visual diffing and debugger to narrow down bounding box and stroke-width miscalculations.

---

## Key Learnings

- Improved understanding of **SVG rendering logic** and path construction.
- Got hands-on exposure to **Storybook**, and how visual tests can improve modular development.
- Understood the **difference between data representations** for view (brick tree) and logic (AST).


---

## Next Week's Roadmap

- Start implementing **multi-brick layout rendering**: bricks with children rendered as a tree in the workspace.
- Introduce bounding box calculation utilities for each rendered brick.
- Plan initial strategy for brick connection detection and snapping logic.

---

**Assisting Mentors:** [Devin Ullibari](https://github.com/pikurasa/), [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender)  
**Reporting Period:** 2025-06-09 - 2025-06-15

## Goals for This Week

- Finalize SVG path logic for all three types of bricks  
- Categorize and document all props passed into bricks  
- Identify all visual states a brick can be rendered in  
- Differentiate props and states across brick types  
- Write comprehensive tests to verify correctness

---

## This Week’s Highlights

### 1. Full SVG Path Generation Logic

- Completed \`generatePath\` support for all three brick types (Simple, Expression and Compound)  
- Rendering now properly reflects scaling, argument slots, top/bottom notches, and label widths  
- Edge cases such as bricks with long labels or stacked arguments handled correctly

### 2. Brick Input Prop Categorization

- Catalogued all props across types (\`strokeWidth\`, \`scaleFactor\`, \`bBoxLabel\`, \`bBoxArgs\`, etc.)  
- Documented their role in layout computation and how they influence final SVG shape

### 3. Brick State Documentation

- Mapped out all possible states a brick can be rendered in (e.g. with/without label, multiple args, missing notches)  
- This will help improve clarity for both debugging and future features

### 4. Type-wise Prop/State Differentiation

- Clearly separated the logic for how each brick type handles its props and rendering states  
- This abstraction allows brick-specific customizations without breaking general rendering flow

### 5. Unified Brick Test File

- Created a comprehensive Jest test file to validate path generation against expected output  
- Covers edge cases like empty arguments, multiple stacked args, and variable heights

📄 Reference: [Props & States Document – Tab 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C0t4iSze2eDEv6lWbloK3MnvJgAa6HvmXmk2sQ0lCZs/edit?tab=t.99d6uc7vheda)

---

## Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge: Mismatched Bounding Box Heights in Some Brick Types**  
In initial tests, actual brick heights didn’t match the combined heights of \`bBoxLabel\` and \`bBoxArgs\`.  
**Solution:** Identified a calculation flaw in vertical layout stacking. Corrected it by properly summing scaled heights and applying consistent spacing logic in path computation.

**Challenge: Supporting All Brick Variants with Shared Logic**  
Bricks share many layout rules, but also diverge in rendering.  
**Solution:** Broke down \`generatePath\` into side-specific functions (\`_generateLeft\`, \`_generateRight\`, etc.) with override support depending on brick type and features like notches.

---

## Key Learnings

- Improved understanding of scalable vector graphics and path-based layout systems  
- Gained hands-on experience in building testable, modular rendering logic  
- Developed systematic thinking around UI state modeling and prop-driven rendering behavior  

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Create React Components(View) to render the bricks with all its properties.
- Create the Model components for the different Brick Types.

# Week 02 Progress Report by Harshit Verma

**Project:** [LLM-powered Debugger for Pippy](https://github.com/sugarlabs/Pippy/issues/95)  
**Mentors:** [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender), [Ibiam Chihurumnaya](https://github.com/chimosky), [Kshitij Shah](https://github.com/kshitijdshah99)  
**Assisting Mentors:** [Devin Ulibarri](https://github.com/pikurasa)  
**Reporting Period:** 2025-06-09 - 2025-06-15  

---

## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** Set up a basic FastAPI server.
- **Goal 2:** Integrate a Hugging Face model.
- **Goal 3:** Add 'Run and Debug' buttons to Pippy UI.
- **Goal 4:** Connect Pippy to the FastAPI Server.

---

## This Week’s Achievements

1. **Built FastAPI Server with \`/debug\` Endpoint**  
   - Created a simple FastAPI app that listens for POST requests at \`/debug\`.
   - The endpoint accepts raw Python code, forwards it to the model, and returns debug tips.

2. **Integrated Hugging Face Model**  
   - Loaded a lightweight model (Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct) from Hugging Face using \`transformers\`.
   - Connected the model with the \`/debug\` endpoint to generate relevant debugging suggestions.

3. **Updated Pippy UI with Debugging Controls**  
   - Added 'Run and Debug' buttons to the Pippy interface.
    ![Pippy UI: Run and Debug](assets/Images/pippy_run&debug.png)
   - This was designed to trigger actions like execute code and get debugging feedback.

4. **Connected Pippy to the FastAPI Server**  
   - Implemented functionality to extract code from the Pippy editor.
    \`\`\`Python
    #To extract the source code

    def _get_current_code(self):
        pippy_tmp_dir = '%s/tmp/' % self.get_activity_root()
        current_file = os.path.join(
            pippy_tmp_dir,
            self._source_tabs.get_current_file_name()
        )

        try:
            with open(current_file, 'r') as f:
                return f.read()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error reading file {current_file}: {e}")
            return None
    \`\`\`   
   - Successfully set up an API call from Pippy to the FastAPI server when the 'Run and Debug' button is clicked.

---

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Running the model locally on CPU.  
  **Solution:** Faced performance limitations due to lack of GPU support. I resolved this by selecting a small, efficient model from Hugging Face.

- **Challenge:** Using GTK for Pippy UI integration.  
  **Solution:**  Since GTK was new to me, adding buttons and handling events required exploring GTK documentation and existing Sugar activity patterns. With guidance and trial-and-error, I successfully added and wired up the 'Run and Debug' button to Pippy’s interface.

---

## Key Learnings

- Learned how to build and structure an API with FastAPI.
- Gained experience integrating Hugging Face models programmatically.
- Understood how to bridge frontend (Pippy) with backend (FastAPI) effectively.
- Improved at working across virtual machines, ports, and networking setups.

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Improve prompt engineering for better debugging tips.
- Add visual display of debug tips in the Pippy interface.
- Integrate sugar-ai with Pippy.

# Week 02 Progress Report by Nikhil Bhatt

**Project:** [Git backend for Musicblocks](https://github.com/benikk/musicblocks-backend)  
**Mentors:** [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender), [Sumit Srivastava](https://github.com/sum2it)  
**Reporting Period:** 2025-06-7 – 2025-06-14  

---

## Goals for This Week

- **Implement an edit route** to allow users to update project data securely using hashed keys.
- **Design and implement a forking mechanism** where users can fork existing project repositories into new independent ones.
- **Integrate project origin tracking** in forked repos through metadata.

---

## This Week's Achievements

1. **Edit Project Functionality**
   - Created a secure API endpoint that allows users to update their project repository content using a key-authenticated system.
   - The backend checks the key hash stored in the \`metaData.json\` before applying any updates.
   - PR: [Edit Project API](https://github.com/BeNikk/musicblocks-backend/commit/1f61a089de7d8dbede2d46a101611133a1190bf6)

2. **Fork Project Repository**
   - Developed a new feature that enables students to fork other students' public projects into their own repositories under the same organization.
   - Forked repositories retain original content (\`projectData.json\`, \`metaData.json\`) and include the original repository link in the metadata (\`forkedFrom\` field).
   - PR: [Fork Feature](https://github.com/BeNikk/musicblocks-backend/commit/d1b7220476dc1fd58c1b38dc59c8a4991871ac45)

3. **Project Metadata Enhancements**
   - Updated the metadata structure to support fork tracking and improve key validation.
   - Ensured consistency between project ownership, fork source, and editing rights.

---

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Understanding and handling GitHub’s \`SHA\` and \`Base64\` requirements when editing file content through the API.  
  **Solution:** Read GitHub API docs and integrated \`Buffer.from(...).toString('base64')\` and used file \`sha\` to ensure proper file overwrites.

- **Challenge:** Unsure if re-initializing Octokit and generating a new installation token per request was optimal.  
  **Solution:** Kept this approach for now as each request is stateless and works correctly. Optimization will be explored after baseline features are stable.

---

## Key Learnings

- Learned how to **authenticate and authorize edits** to GitHub repos using hashed keys and GitHub’s content API.
- Understood the internal structure of GitHub forks and metadata handling.
- Improved knowledge of **Octokit**, GitHub APIs, and best practices for writing file content (\`projectData.json\`, \`metaData.json\`) to a repo.

---

## Next Week's Roadmap

- Add **pull request functionality** between forked and original projects.
- Improve project listing UI with fork indicators.
- Begin planning for collaborator permissions and PR review workflow.

---

## Resources & References

- **GitHub API Docs:** [REST Reference](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)
- **Octokit:** [octokit/rest.js](https://github.com/octokit/rest.js)
- **MetaData Example:** \`metaData.json\` includes \`hashedKey\`, \`theme\`, and \`forkedFrom\`.

# Week 2 Progress Report by Safwan Sayeed

**Project:** Music Blocks 4 Program Engine  
**Mentors:** [Anindya Kundu](https://github.com/meganindya/), [Sumit Srivastava](https://github.com/sum2it)  
**Assisting Mentors:** [Devin Ullibari](https://github.com/pikurasa/), [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender)  
**Reporting Period:** 2025-06-09 - 2025-06-15  

---

## A Blog-style Retrospective

This week was all about diving deep into the memory architecture for the Music Blocks program engine. After completing our comprehensive AST framework in week 1, we shifted focus to building the foundational memory management system that will power program execution. The challenge was designing a three-scope memory hierarchy (Global, Thread, Local) with full CRUD operations while keeping the implementation clean and focused.

Working alongside Karan Palan, we expanded our tech spec to include detailed memory module specifications. The mentors provided crucial guidance on scope requirements, emphasizing the need for thread isolation, and multi-level local scope support.

---

## Goals for This Week

- Complete the memory module technical specification with three-scope architecture details.
- Develop full CRUD operations for global variables accessible from any scope.
- Implement it with tests.

---

## This Week's Highlights

1. **Memory Module Tech Specification**  
   - Expanded the tech spec with comprehensive memory architecture documentation covering three-scope system.
   - Detailed CRUD operation requirements for global, thread, and local scope variables.
   - Link: [Tech Spec Document - Memory Section](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_MCCgl-RqiEQH0UQ4EX-2O6G4iRxgHAY1rZpw3QPXT0/edit?tab=t.3xe7coiooljb#heading=h.s3q9swsg3ifd)


2. **Memory Module CRUD Operations**  
   - Started Implementing the CRUD Operations for the Scopes

---

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Understanding Scope Hierarchy Complexity:**  
  The three-scope system (Global, Thread, Local) with proper variable shadowing was conceptually challenging.  
  *Solution:* Studied the existing reference implementation and created detailed diagrams to visualize scope relationships.


---

## Key Learnings

- Mastered hierarchical data structure design with proper encapsulation and scope isolation.
- Gained deep understanding of variable shadowing and scope resolution mechanisms.
- Enhanced collaboration skills working on complex architecture with multiple contributors.

---

## Next Week's Roadmap

- Begin symbol table implementation building on the memory module foundation.
- IR Implementation
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all memory module CRUD operations.

# Week 02 Progress Report by Diwangshu Kakoty

**Project:** [AI Tools for Reflection](https://github.com/Commanderk3/reflection_ai)  
**Mentors:** [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender), [Sumit Srivastava](https://github.com/sum2it)  
**Assisting Mentors:** [Devin Ulibarri](https://github.com/pikurasa), [Ajeet Pratap Singh](https://github.com/apsinghdev)  
**Reporting Period:** 2025-06-08 - 2025-06-14  

---

## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** Develop a chat model consisting of multiple AI agents/mentors.
- **Goal 2:** Improve the 'Analysis' generation.
- **Goal 3:** Try and test different embedding models.
- **Goal 4:** Fix bugs occured by these changes.

---

## This Week’s Achievements

1. **AI Mentors**  
   - From the last meeting with my mentor, I received feedback on having specialised AI mentors for areas of expertise, such as music and coding. Hence, I have implemented a way to have conversations with mentors in music, code, and meta.

   - *Music Mentor* : Handles reflection for music learning.

   - *Code Mentor* : Handles programming concepts and debugging reflection. Users can paste their simplified project code for better feedback and guidance.

   - *Meta Facilitator* : Guides general reflective thinking (learning goals, struggles, progress).

2. **Improve Analysis Generation**  
   - As mentioned in the last report, the analysis was inaccurate. I have refined the instructions, and now it functions effectively. It did not take much time.

3. **Tested various Embedding Model**  
   - Embedding models are machine learning models that convert complex data such as text, images, or audio into numerical representations called embeddings. I am using \`all-MiniLM-L6-v2\`, which is lightweight and fast. Although it is lightweight, it is still quite effective. I have not found better models than this, so I will stick with this model for now. 

---

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge 1 :** The LLM needs to be invoked with the user query, retrieved context, and message history. Since this project involves multiple AI agents, it is somewhat tricky to decide what kind of memory space to use. Possible ways to store messages:

  i) Shared memory space: Each agent will use one common message history with named tags to differentiate among themselves. This way, the AI agents won't repeat questions.

  ii) Separate memory space: Each agent will have their own space. This way, we can prevent confusion for the LLM. However, the trade-off is space. Additionally, we need to pass these message histories separately for summary generation.

  **Solution:** I first implemented the second option because it is simple and works fine, but the summary generation needs to be done separately for each agent, which I don't think is ideal. Therefore, I have decided to try the first option. I have already started working on it. I need to fix some bugs, and it will be completed by tomorrow (2025-06-16).

- **Challenge 2 :** Retrieved context is irrelevant when the project code is passed. The retriever component returns three chunks arranged in priority. However, a project code can contain many keywords, making the retriever not particularly useful.

  **Solution:** I am considering scanning all the keywords (like block names) first and passing their information to the LLM. This data will be stored in a dictionary. Example:

\`\`\`python
blocks = {
    "Action": "An Action block contains a sequence of actions that will only be executed when the block is referred to by something else, such as a start block.",
    "Start": "A Start Block is an Action that will automatically be executed once the start button is pressed."
}
\`\`\`
This way the LLM can understand block structure and their meaning as well.

---

## Key Learnings

- The prototype for this project is developing in Streamlit, and I am learning Streamlit a lot.
- Also gainig experience in LangChain as this is the primary tool of development.

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Work on things suggested by mentors.
- Fix challenge no. 2 as mentioned above.
- Start preparing for the frontend interface.

# Week 02 Progress Report by Om Santosh Suneri

**Project:** [AI-powered Debugger for Music Blocks](https://github.com/omsuneri/AI-powered-Debugger-for-Music-Blocks)  
**Mentors:** [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender/) [Sumit Srivastava](https://github.com/sum2it)

## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** Enhance and Polish the Converter code
- **Goal 2:** To Make the JSON to Text Converter Publicly Accessible
- **Goal 3:** To Develop a Basic RAG Debugger for Music Blocks

---

## This Week’s Achievements

1. **Enhance and Polish the Converter code**  
   - I refined the output of the JSON to Text Converter by improving how blocks, parameters, and nested structures are represented. I also optimized the formatting and added clearer visual symbols to make the structure easier to follow.
   - A well-structured and readable output is critical for debugging and learning. These enhancements make the converter not only functional but truly useful, especially for beginners who may be overwhelmed by raw JSON. The clarity improvements bridge the gap between raw code and conceptual understanding.
   - GitHub Repository: [JSON to Text representation](https://github.com/omsuneri/JSON-to-Text-representation)

2. **To Make the JSON to Text Converter Publicly Accessible**  
   - I deployed the Music Blocks JSON to Text Converter as a static web tool using GitHub Pages. This involved setting up the project structure for deployment, ensuring browser compatibility, and verifying that the tool works seamlessly for any user without needing local installation.
   - By making the converter publicly accessible, I’ve removed a major barrier for non-technical users who want to understand or debug Music Blocks projects. Now, anyone can paste their JSON and instantly see a human-readable text format, making it easier to interpret the project logic, especially for educators and learners.
   - JSON to Text Converter: [Live Demo](https://omsuneri.github.io/JSON-to-Text-representation/)

3. **To Develop a Basic RAG Debugger for Music Blocks**  
   - I created the initial version of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) app that acts as a debugger for Music Blocks. It uses Google Gemini (free API) for natural language responses and Qdrant as a vector database to search over relevant Music Blocks documentation and sample project data.
   - This is the first step toward an AI-powered assistant that can help users understand errors, debug project files, and learn concepts interactively. It lays the groundwork for a smarter, more accessible debugging experience tailored specifically to the Music Blocks environment.
   - GitHub Repository: [AI-powered Debugger for Music Blocks](https://github.com/omsuneri/AI-powered-Debugger-for-Music-Blocks)

---


## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Error 99 – Deployment Failure due to Network Binding  
  **Solution:** I updated the Gemini API implementation to avoid explicitly binding to a local address and ensured it followed the correct networking model for serverless deployment. I also verified that no hardcoded host values (like 127.0.0.1) were used and that the requests use standard internet routes.

- **Challenge:** Reducing Container Size from 7.1 GB to Under 4 GB  
  **Solution:** I explored two approaches:
   - Optimization: I removed redundant or unused files from the embedding directory and ensured the vector database stored only the most relevant documents.
   - Cloud-based Embeddings: I evaluated storing the embeddings externally (e.g., by using a hosted Qdrant instance or remote storage) so that the app could load them at runtime, rather than bundling them in the container.These optimizations brought the container size within limits and made the app deployable on Railway.

---

## Key Learnings

- Deployment environments have strict constraints that require optimization and flexibility
I learned that successful deployment isn’t just about writing functional code — it's equally about managing resources (like container size) and handling platform-specific limitations, such as networking and storage.
- Early-stage AI apps benefit greatly from clear modularity and cloud-ready design
While building the RAG debugger, I realized the importance of designing components (like embeddings, API logic, and vector search) to be loosely coupled and scalable, which helps avoid technical roadblocks during cloud deployment.

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Deploy the AI-Powered Debugger App to a Cloud Hosting Platform.
- Create Embeddings from Music Blocks Project Text Representations.
- Improve LLM Response Language for Kids and Junior Learners.

# Week 02 Progress Report by Muhammad Haroon

**Project:** [Generative AI Instrument Sample Generation for Music Blocks](https://github.com/sugarlabs/GSoC/blob/master/Ideas-2025.md#Generative-AI-Instrument-Sample-Generation-for-Music-Blocks)

**Reporting Period:** 2025-06-09 - 2025-06-15  

---

## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** Set up AudioGen locally.
- **Goal 2:** Create a UI using streamlit.

---

## This Week's Achievements

1. **Set up AudioGen locally**  
   - I was able to set up AudioGen locally for that I followed [AudioGen docs](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft/blob/main/docs/AUDIOGEN.md). I also created a virtual environment and a requirements.txt file to make the project easier to run.

2. **Create a UI using streamlit**  
   - I also created a UI using streamlit with the help of the [Streamlit docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/).

---

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** The challenge I actually faced was due to limited resources. AudioCraft (which provides AudioGen) requires a GPU with at least 16 GB of memory for running inference with the medium-sized models (~1.5B parameters). For generating 5 minutes duration of audio, it took around 15-20 minutes.  
- **Solution:** I ran the model and used the waiting time to complete other tasks. I plan to deploy the model on AWS, where I expect significantly better performance. 

---

## Key Learnings

- Gained familiarity with **Streamlit**

---

## Next Week's Roadmap

- Generate more samples using AudioGen and save them in Google Drive.

    - Now :  
        ![Mode selector Now](https://i.ibb.co/60NHStQy/image.png)


7. **Merged Paint and Learn mode**
    - Implemented a modal system that appears in the bottom-right corner when users click on body parts in paint mode.
    - Added fade-in/fade-out transitions with CSS transforms for better user experience and added duplicate prevention system that removes existing modals before showing new ones.
     ![Paint Modal](https://i.ibb.co/7tW0PdzH/image.png)
     


---

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Maintaining proper alignment while modifying 3D organ models.  
  **Solution:** Used Blender’s measurement tools to iteratively adjust spacing, followed by live testing in the Sugarizer environment.  

- **Challenge:** Creating paint mode notifications that don't interfere with 3D interaction.  
  **Solution:** Developed bottom-right positioned modals with smooth animations and automatic cleanup to maintain workflow continuity while providing clear user feedback.

## Text Formatting

**Bold text** or __also bold text__

*Italic text* or _also italic text_

***Bold and italic text*** or ___also bold and italic___

~~Strikethrough text~~

==Highlighted text with custom styling==

Super^script^ text and Sub~script~ text

Here's some \`inline code\` within a paragraph for demonstration.

## Code Examples

### Inline Code vs Code Blocks

Single backticks for \`inline code highlighting\` like \`const variable = "value"\` or \`npm install\`.

### Code Blocks with Language Support

\`\`\`javascript
// JavaScript example with syntax highlighting
function calculateSum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

const result = calculateSum(5, 10);
console.log(\`The sum is: \${result}\`);
\`\`\`

\`\`\`python
# Python example
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Generate first 10 Fibonacci numbers
for i in range(10):
    print(f"F({i}) = {fibonacci(i)}")
\`\`\`

\`\`\`typescript
// TypeScript example
interface User {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    email: string;
}

const createUser = (userData: Partial<User>): User => {
    return {
        id: Date.now(),
        name: userData.name || "Anonymous",
        email: userData.email || "user@example.com"
    };
};

# Week 01 Progress Report by Aman Chadha\r
\r
**Project:** [JS Internationalization with AI Translation Support](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/pull/4459)  \r
\r
**Mentors:** [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender)\r
\r
**Reporting Period:** 2025-06-02 - 2025-06-08\r
\r
---\r
\r
## Goals for This Week\r
\r
- Develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model using the core files of Music Blocks to provide context-aware responses.\r
- Collect and parse .po files, extracting msgid and msgstr pairs along with comments showing usage in source files.\r
- Use AST parsing (with Babel) to gather metadata chunks from source files to improve retrieval relevance.\r
\r
---\r
\r
## This Week’s Achievements\r
\r
1. **RAG Model Development**  \r
   - Started working on building a RAG model focused on the core Music Blocks files. This aims to give the model context about what Music Blocks is and how it functions, improving answer relevance.\r
   \r
2. **Metadata Extraction from .po Files**  \r
   - Successfully collected msgid and msgstr pairs from translation files.\r
   - Parsed comments above the translations to identify which files use each msgstr.\r
   \r
3. **AST Parsing and Chunking**  \r
   - Used Babel to parse Music Blocks source files and extract relevant code chunks.\r
   - Stored these chunks with their associated metadata to enable better context retrieval during RAG.\r
\r
---\r
\r
## Challenges & How I Overcame Them\r
\r
- **Challenge:** Parsing complex .po files with varied comment styles and ensuring correct association of usage metadata.  \r
  **Solution:** Created robust parsing scripts to handle different comment formats and verified chunk associations manually on sample files.\r
\r
- **Challenge:** Extracting meaningful code chunks via AST parsing while maintaining useful granularity.  \r
  **Solution:** Experimented with different AST traversal strategies and filters to optimize chunk size for retrieval.\r
\r
---\r
\r
## Key Learnings\r
\r
- Gained deeper understanding of the internals of Music Blocks core files and their translation system.\r
- Improved skills with Babel AST parsing and metadata extraction techniques.\r
- Learned the importance of detailed metadata in enhancing RAG model retrieval accuracy.\r
\r
---\r
\r
## Next Week’s Roadmap\r
\r
- Build a demo to showcase the RAG model's ability to answer Music Blocks-related queries with context from core files.\r
- Begin integrating metadata-enriched .po file chunks into the RAG database for improved translation string retrieval.\r
- Optimize chunking and metadata tagging strategy based on initial demo feedback.\r

# Week 02 Progress Report by Aman Chadha\r
\r
**Project:** [JS Internationalization with AI Translation Support](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/pull/4459)  \r
**Mentors:** [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender)  \r
**Assisting Mentors:** *None this week*  \r
**Reporting Period:** 2025-06-09 - 2025-06-16  \r
\r
---\r
\r
## Goals for This Week\r
\r
- **Refactor RAG model output** to a structured dictionary format that includes part-of-speech (POS) tagging.\r
- **Optimize AST-based chunking** by limiting code context to 5 lines above and below translation usage, per mentor feedback.\r
- **Begin functional testing** of the updated RAG pipeline on real-world translation queries.\r
\r
---\r
\r
## This Week's Achievements\r
\r
1. **RAG Output Enhancement**  \r
   - Refactored the Retrieval-Augmented Generation model to return results as structured dictionaries.\r
   - Each entry now includes \`msgid\`, \`msgstr\`, source metadata, and the dominant part of speech, improving retrieval relevance.\r
\r
2. **Code Chunking Optimization**  \r
   - Reduced each extracted code chunk to include only 5 lines above and below the relevant \`msgid\` usage.\r
   - This improves retrieval precision and avoids irrelevant surrounding code.  \r
   - Implemented using Babel’s AST traversal logic.\r
\r
3. **Initial Model Testing**  \r
   - Started testing the RAG model using sample translation queries.\r
   - Observed noticeable improvements in answer context relevance due to cleaner chunks and richer metadata.\r
\r
---\r
\r
## Challenges & How I Overcame Them\r
\r
- **Challenge:** Integrating POS tagging meaningfully into the RAG data pipeline.  \r
  **Solution:** Designed a dictionary schema that includes the part-of-speech alongside translation metadata, and verified correctness using test entries.\r
\r
- **Challenge:** Tuning chunk granularity without losing contextual utility.  \r
  **Solution:** Followed mentor Walter’s advice to use fixed ±5 line windows, and manually verified semantic coherence of resulting chunks.\r
\r
---\r
\r
## Key Learnings\r
\r
- Part-of-speech tagging can significantly improve the contextual strength of retrieved translations.\r
- Smaller, focused code chunks often result in better retrieval precision for RAG applications.\r
- Mentor feedback and collaborative iteration are key to refining both code structure and user outcomes.\r
\r
---\r
\r
## Next Week's Roadmap\r
\r
- Integrate POS-tagged RAG responses into the full i18n fallback translation pipeline.\r
- Expand test coverage to include edge-case translations and re-used \`msgid\`s.\r
- Prepare an internal demo to show RAG-powered retrieval resolving contextually ambiguous translation strings.\r

## What makes Sugar different?  
It would be nice to define what we are talking about when we say "Sugar," since we have multiple platforms. For example, is this page dedicated to Sugar as a desktop environment, or do we want to make this broader to include web apps, Sugarizer, etc.?  

- **Sugar facilitates sharing and collaboration**: children can write articles, share books, or make music together with a single mouse click.  
- **Activities, not applications**: Sugar activities are applicable beyond the scope of the classroom and even Sugar itself.  
- **Automatic backup of Activity work**: No worrying about files or folders. Sugar’s Journal makes it almost impossible to lose any data.  
- **The Journal records everything you do**: It is a place to reflect upon and evaluate your work.  
- **Sugar runs on most computer hardware**, including slower machines.  
- **Sugar is Free (Libre) Software**: It is written in Python and easily customized.  
- **Sugar is documented by its users**: It is easy to use, and teachers worldwide have created a wealth of pedagogical materials for it.  
- **Sugar is written by its users**: 50% of the updates to our latest release came directly from our users.  
  - It would be nice to have a link here, for reference.  

## What are the benefits of using Sugar?  
- **Hundreds of tools for discovery**: Exploring, expressing, and sharing through online research, writing, coding, and more.  
- **Built-in collaboration system**: Peer-to-peer learning; always-on support; and single-click sharing.  
  - What is "always-on support"?  
- **A built-in portfolio assessment tool** called Journal that serves as a forum for discussion between children, parents, and teachers.  
- **A discoverable learning platform**: It uses simple means to reach complex ends.  
  - What do we mean by "discoverable"? That we can use the platform to discover ideas?  
- **Designed for local appropriation**: Sugar has built-in tools for making changes and improvements and a growing global community of support.  
  - Twenty-five languages are currently available.  
- **An emphasis on learning through doing and debugging**: Engages learners better to tackle authentic problems.  
- **Available in a wide variety of forms**: As part of GNU/Linux distributions, as well as LiveCD, LiveUSB, and in a virtual machine for Windows and Mac machines.  

## What are the Sugar advantages?  
- **Pedagogical framework** centered around Constructionism learning and founded on student empowerment.  
- **Collaboration and journaling features**, uniquely designed by educators for educators and learners.  
- **Hundreds of activities**.  
- **Large and committed community** of developers, teachers, and learners from all around the globe.  
  - Perhaps it would be nice to have numbers here, if possible.  
- **24/7 community support**.  
  - What do we mean by this? That we are available by Matrix/IRC?  
- **Online and in-person training and workshops available**.  
- **Handouts available to use in the classroom**.  
- **Teacher-driven development**, rapidly expanding every day.  
- **Easily localizable and customizable**.  
- **Free/Libre software**: No licensing fees.  
- **A global project**: No single point of dependency or failure.  

## A *learning-centric* approach  
At Sugar Labs, we strive for a *learning-centric* approach, where teachers mentor students as they engage with powerful ideas, or *instructing less and learning more*.  

At Sugar Labs, we give children access to *knowledge*—through media such as electronic books, the world-wide web, and multimedia—but, more importantly, we give them the tools they need to *create*, to learn about learning, to put knowledge to use, and engage in reflection and critical dialogue.  

With Sugar, we help learners *acquire knowledge* so that they grow as active consumers, critics, and *creators of knowledge*; Sugar welcomes them as members of a vibrant learning community.  

Plus, cross-community collaboration between technologists and teachers ensures that the ideals of student empowerment, freedom, sharing, open critique, and transparency will remain an integral part of Sugar—one that touches the lives of children and their communities all across the world’s classrooms.  

## The Free (Libre) Software culture  
The Sugar pedagogy is embodied in the culture of Free/Libre Software; teachers and students are empowered with both the freedom to actively participate and the freedom to be critical.  

Criticism of ideas is a powerful force in learning, as well as in fostering economic development; unleashing this potential is an important part of our mission.

## Background  
The Sugar Learning Platform (Sugar) was first developed as the software platform for the One Laptop per Child (OLPC) program, a spin-off project from the MIT Media Lab in 2006.  

The founders of OLPC, Nicholas Negroponte, Seymour Papert, and Walter Bender, promoted the idea that learning is not a luxury and that a lack of an educated society is not just an inconvenience. Learning is fundamental to a free society that aspires to be both prosperous and sustainable. All societies value the role that education plays in economic development, and education is essential to the survival of democratic societies.  

Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon, co-inventors of the Logo programming language (along with Wally Feurzeig), described their pioneering efforts to use the Logo language as a vehicle for introducing children to computational thinking. They defined it in terms of heuristics: things to think with and reflect upon.  

In 1971, Papert and Solomon published *“20 Things to do with a Computer”*, a catalog of project ideas ranging from robotics to music to visual arts. This work foreshadowed what today is often referred to as the *Maker Movement*. Almost 50 years ago, children were using Logo as a tool for the autonomous construction of meaningful artifacts and pursuing mastery in solving personally meaningful problems.

## Sugar Pedagogy  
> **“Learning is hard fun.”** – Marvin Minsky  
> **“A six-year-old child can become an expert.”** – Marvin Minsky  

In a 2008 essay questioning “general” education, Marvin Minsky proposed that we *“re-aim our schools towards encouraging children to pursue more focused hobbies and specialties—to provide them with more time for (and earlier experience with) developing more powerful sets of mental skills, which they later can extend to more academic activities.”*  

Minsky encourages children to construct multi-level *cognitive towers*, built upon:  
- Instinctive reactions  
- Learned reactions  
- Deliberate thinking  
- Reflective thinking  
- Self-reflective thinking  
- Self-conscious reflection  

These levels span agencies specializing in areas such as gaining knowledge from experience, planning and causal attribution, the construction of models, and identifying values and ideals.  

A focus on achieving meaningful goals—not just the accumulation of simple knowledge objects—exercises all levels in a cognitive tower, helping children *develop proficiencies that can be used in other domains*. As a model for learning, the levels within Minsky’s cognitive towers represent broadly applicable skills.  

Minsky’s towers are inherently complex and require a learner to be motivated and persistent in their construction—a process he once described as *"hard fun."*  

This aligns with research by Daniel Pink, who reviewed four decades of studies showing that motivation for learning comes from:  
1. **Autonomy** – the freedom to explore and express ideas  
2. **Mastery** – confidence and space to develop expertise  
3. **Purpose** – authentic problem-solving opportunities  

A key insight of Minsky, Papert, and Solomon is to give children tools they can explore, master, and apply to problems they care about. Children using Sugar are **motivated learners**, pursuing meaningful goals that help them build their own “cognitive towers.”`,va=Object.freeze(Object.defineProperty({__proto__:null,default:dn},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"})),un=`---

## Student and teacher agency

Sugar provides the user with affordances (things we designed for the possibility of taking action by the user) and pathways to engage in developing skills. Sugar is not instructional curricula in part because curricula tend to reflect very local norms and needs, and as a consequence, are resistant to global solutions. 

Also, Sugar reflects an explicit rejection of instruction as a pedagogical framework. With Sugar, we try to give agency to the learner, knowing that in all likelihood, the institution of school would likely be trying to take away agency. At each design decision point, we asked ourselves:  
- *How will this impact the learning?*  
- *How will this impact the autonomy and agency of the learner and the teacher?*

Agency is made possible in part because of the choice of a software license, the **General Public License (GPL)**, which ensures that the learner has permission to both use Sugar and to modify it. 

We go a step further by giving the learner affordances to engage in software development and debugging, i.e., to exploit the license. We provide a context for encouraging the learner to take initiative, both by deliberately leaving the platform “incomplete” and by providing a social norm in which it is expected to take initiative. Even if it were possible to make Sugar “complete”, we would have chosen not to. We wanted there always to be “itches” needing to be scratched.  

In a related design decision, Sugar was never intended to be an endpoint in and of itself. Rather, we envisioned it as a waypoint along a lifelong journey of learning. We encourage our users to outgrow Sugar and even provide them with a means of advancing from the Sugar desktop, with its tools for exploration, to the **GNOME desktop**, with its more powerful tools for production.

---

## What using Sugar can do for your students and school?

The **Sugar Learning Platform** was designed to promote collaborative learning through tools and activities that encourage critical thinking. Sugar puts an emphasis on divergent thinking. A related goal is to make that thinking visible to the learner. 

Sugar equally promotes cultures of **expression and reflection**. With Sugar, we provide teachers and learners with a collection of open-ended tools and activities, applicable to problems of their own choosing.

### Sugar offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software based on three affordances:

1. **Sharing:**  
   Collaboration is a first-order experience. The interface always shows the presence of other learners who are available for collaboration. Sugar allows users to dialog, support, critique, and share ideas with each other.

2. **Reflecting:**  
   A "journal" records each learner’s activity. It is a built-in space for reflection and assessment of progress.

3. **Discovering:**  
   Sugar tries to accommodate a wide variety of users with different levels of skill in terms of reading and language and different levels of experience with computing by providing activities with a "low floor" and, where possible, "no ceiling."

> **“The only time collaboration is called cheating is when you are in school.” – Walter Bender**

Sugar drew inspiration for its activities and the fluid interface between activities from observing how the **free software community** collaborates. Software developers chat, socialize, play games, share media, and collaborate on media creation and programming in both formal and informal settings.

Sugar users are given access to a variety of commonly used tools for collaboration, e.g., **Chat and IRC**. By default, the IRC application opens into the \`#sugar\` channel on \`irc.freenode.net\`, where Sugar developers discuss their work.

---

## Reflection and assessment in the context of Sugar and interoperability with school administrative systems

In the early days of the development of the Sugar user interface, one of the biggest points of contention with the OLPC advisory board was when we told them that we were not going to use **file browsing** as the primary mode of navigation. We were asked,  
*"How will the children learn to use Windows?"*  
Our response was, *"Why do they need to learn to use Windows?"*  

Instead of browsing a filesystem, Sugar gives the user a **journal or notebook** into which one’s work is “kept” rather than “saved.” The interface tries to keep things that offer value automatically in the Sugar journal.

The primary function of the journal is as a **time-based view** of the activities of a learner. As with physical media, such as pen on paper, no explicit "saving" step is needed. The individual journal entries are treated much like pages in a **laboratory notebook**.

### Assessment in Sugar:
- **Digital Portfolio:**  
  Sugar journal entries are directly incorporated into **digital portfolios** to support reflection that can help students (as well as teachers and parents) be aware of their own learning.
- **Impact Measurement:**  
  Sugar acknowledges the need for **measurement and evaluation**. Sugar does not take a position on high-stake testing but advocates for an evaluation that looks more broadly than standardized tests.
- **Custom Metadata for Journal Entries:**  
  Teachers can know what tools a student may have used and how many iterations they made in creating an artifact.

## Student Learning Goals and Sugar

> *"Learning with Sugar is something a child does, not something that is done to or for a child." – Walter Bender*

Sugar is a collection of hundreds of tools designed to introduce children to programming, computational thinking, and problem-solving. Sugar has no set curriculum; its best practice is to immerse children in problem-solving and debugging. Children are given agency to work on problems they are passionate about in a context where there is an expectation that there were no predetermined solutions or prescribed paths to a solution. 

As Solomon observed, *“debugging is the greatest learning opportunity of the 21st century.”* While engaged in problem-solving, children are developing and refining the algorithms employed by the agents in the various levels of their cognitive towers.

While computation and coding are at the heart of Sugar, Sugar is not a programming curriculum: computational thinking goes well beyond the realm of learning to code. While the specific algorithms they discuss—searching, sorting, optimal stopping, predicting, etc.—are useful in and of themselves, the real power of computational thinking lies in its systematic approach to debugging and problem-solving. 

Learning that problems can be addressed systematically is the underlying **“powerful idea”** of programming. The process of writing and then repairing or **debugging** a program provides a basis for active learning through trial and error, regardless of what the problem that is actually being solved.

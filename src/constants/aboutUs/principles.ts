    "Sugar Labs is founded on a set of fundamental principles that guide our work. We believe, for example, that learning is a verb, and we therefore create tools to learn with. We also believe in the freedom to study how one's tools work, and we therefore license all our work under a FLO license. Read on to learn more about our commitment to these principles, as well as our commitment to equity, community, accessibility, and hard fun.",

      'Music Blocks is a fork of TurtleArtJS created by Walter Bender. (Turtle Blocks JS has many contributors).\n Devin Ulibarri has contributed functional and user-interface designs. Many of his contributions were inspired by the music education ideas, representations and practices (e.g. aspects of matrix, musical cups) developed and published by Dr. Lawrence Scripp with whom Devin studied at New England Conservatory and for whom he worked at Affron Scripp & Associates, LLC.\n Much of the initial coding of the fork from Turtle Blocks was done by Yash Khandelwal as part of Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2015. Hemant Kasat contributed to additional widgets as part of GSoC 2016. Additional contributions are being made by Tayba Wasim, Dinuka Tharangi Jayaweera, Prachi Agrawal, Cristina Del Puerto, and Hrishi Patel as part of GSoC 2017. During GSoC 2018, Riya Lohia developed a Temperament Widget. Ritwik Abhishek added a keyboard widget and a pitch-tracking widget.\n Many students contributed to the project as part of Google Code-in (2015–16, 2016–17, and 2017–2018). Sam Parkinson built the Planet during GCI 2016–17. Euan Ong redesigned the Planet code as a series of GCI tasks in 2017–18.',

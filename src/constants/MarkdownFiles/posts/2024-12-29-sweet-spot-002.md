# Recent news for December 29, 2024

Welcome to the second issue of the **"Sweet Spot"**, a newsletter for Sugar Labs-related news in development, student and teacher work, events, how to get involved, and other news and information. This newsletter will be published semi-regularly for now, but the plan is to publish it on a bi-monthly, perhaps even monthly, basis in the future. Our aim with this newsletter is to help keep the growing body of Sugar Labs contributors on the same page, all while documenting our growth for our own and others' reference.

These first issues are meant to set a precedent of communication and documentation, as well as to help inform the community of our current status, recent progress, and future plans. Its predecessor is the [Sugar Digest](https://lists.sugarlabs.org/archive/community-news/), which still serves as an important catalog of our activities. Like Sugar Digest, this newsletter is intended to keep community members in the loop about everything going on within Sugar Labs. It will highlight any recent publications from us. It will occasionally include links to third-party news and updates that our community finds relevant.

*Your donation helps us in many ways.*

Sugar Labs is in the middle of a campaign to raise funds necessary for outreach, software development, project maintenance, mentorship, and more. Having left Software Freedom Conservancy in 2020, this year is the first that Sugar Labs is investing financially in its own growth, and we'd love to have your participation in this pivotal moment. We've been particularly heartened to see volunteers in our community assist with various aspects of this campaign, such as making improvements to our website. You may also participate in our fundraiser, while getting something nice for yourself or a loved one, by purchasing Sugar Labs merchandise from our new store on Bonfire.

Read executive director Devin Ulibarri's letter to the community to learn more about the work we've done this year, consider making a donation or purchasing merchandise, and please help spread the word.

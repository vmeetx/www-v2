# Week 03 Progress Report by Aman Chadha

**Project:** [JS Internationalization with AI Translation Support](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/pull/4459)  
**Mentors:** [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender), [Devin Ulibarri](https://github.com/devinulibarri)  
**Assisting Mentors:** *None this week*  
**Reporting Period:** 2025-06-17 – 2025-06-23

## Goals for This Week

- Translate a sample set of RAG-generated context strings using AI-powered tools.
- Share Japanese translation variants (Kana and Kanji) with mentors for review.
- Begin building a batch-processing workflow to generate context for all 1535 msgid entries in the .po files.
- Plan an update pipeline to regenerate context for newly added or reused translation strings automatically.

## This Week’s Achievements

1. **Translation of RAG-Generated Contexts**  
   - Translated ~70 RAG-generated context descriptions using DeepL.
   - Shared English and Japanese translations with mentors Walter and Devin for review.
   - For Japanese, provided both **Kana** and **Kanji** variants to ensure localization accuracy.

2. **Batch Processing Pipeline Development**  
   - Initiated work on a batch-processing system to automate RAG context generation for all 1535 msgid entries in the translation .po file.
   - This will drastically reduce manual overhead and improve coverage.

3. **Planning for Context Maintenance Workflow**  
   - Designed a future-proofing plan to automatically detect newly added or reused msgids in pull requests.
   - Began outlining a GitHub Actions-based workflow to regenerate context chunks when changes are merged into the repo.

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Japanese localization required thoughtful distinction between script types (Kana vs Kanji).  
  **Solution:** Generated both forms using translation tools and consulted native guidance to ensure cultural appropriateness.

- **Challenge:** Scaling RAG context generation to 1500+ entries without losing efficiency.  
  **Solution:** Started designing a batch system to streamline the entire generation process and set up hooks for automation in future updates.

## Key Learnings

- Multi-language support requires nuanced translation strategies, especially for languages like Japanese.
- Batch automation is essential when working with large-scale i18n datasets and AI-generated content.
- Proactive planning for long-term maintenance helps keep i18n tooling relevant as the codebase evolves.

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Complete batch-processing implementation for generating RAG context for all msgids.
- Add persistence/storage layer to cache generated results and avoid recomputation.
- Set up a GitHub workflow for regenerating context on new PRs that modify or add translation strings.

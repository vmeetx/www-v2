**Sugar Labs is running an election this fall for three seats to its board of directors. The deadline to apply for a ballot, as well as submit candidacy for the board, is November 24. Sugar Labs community members are encouraged to participate. By submitting an application for a ballot you will also be considered for membership. Current members who do not apply for a ballot will have their membership rescinded.**

The deadline to apply for a ballot and apply for candidacy is fast approaching. Extended to Sunday, the deadline to [apply for a ballot](https://forms.gle/48F6h5wdV6BpSro66) is now November 24, 2024, End of Day (EoD), Anywhere on Earth (AoE). It is also the deadline to [submit for candidacy](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Oversight_Board/2025-2026-candidates#Candidates) for the [board of directors](https://www.sugarlabs.org/leadership/).

### Eligibility to vote

Since we made [our initial announcement](https://www.sugarlabs.org/community/2024/11/08/fall-board-elections-how-to-participate/), one of the most frequently asked questions has been *what determines eligibility for participating in the election?* Participation in the election is open to any member of Sugar Labs, and the eligibility requirements for membership are published on [Sugar Labs Members page](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Members). 

The main gist, however, is that you've made a contribution to Sugar Labs. According to our definition, such a contribution "may be code, documentation, translations, maintenance of project-wide resources, *running a Sugar deployment*, or other non-trivial activities which benefit Sugar Labs."

If you've made such a contribution to Sugar Labs, you are eligible as a member, and, as a member, you may vote. ***Also, if you're not a member or unsure about your status, we still encourage you to submit an application for a ballot.*** We will automatically begin to determine your membership eligibility based on your publicly visible contributions, so no other steps are necessary on your part.

### Current members must vote in this election in order to maintain their membership status

Our most recent membership list may be found [here](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Members/List). If you are currently a member but you do not apply for a ballot to vote in this election, then we will consider your membership to be rescinded and your membership will be made inactive. Because [our bylaws require a majority vote from members to pass certain amendments](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Governance#ARTICLE_XI), we need to ensure that our current membership list is up-to-date with active members.

If you've made a contribution to Sugar Labs in the past, ***we strongly encourage you to vote in this election to maintain your membership status.*** We thank you for your contribution, and we encourage you to continue to participate in Sugar Labs, which is now investing in its growth and expansion like never before.

If it's been a while since you've made a contribution, we encourage you to join us on our main [Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#sugar:matrix.org) and follow us on [GitHub](https://github.com/sugarlabs/). These two channels are currently the most active for coordinating contributions.

### Receive your ballot

We encourage you to vote. The application to receive your ballot, due by the End of Day (EoD), Anywhere on Earth (AoE), November 24, 2024, is [here](https://forms.gle/48F6h5wdV6BpSro66).

### Running for a board position

For those of you who would like to run for a board position, you will need to add your name and statement to the list on the [candidate page](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Oversight_Board/2025-2026-candidates). If you need any technical assistance with the wiki, please contact <elections@sugarlabs.org>.

Candidates should read and understand the terms of the [Sugar Labs Inc.'s Bylaws](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Governance), as well as any domestic and international laws governing participation in a US-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit board.

### Election timeline

The updated timeline of the election is planned as follows, with a deadline to receive ballot applications for the End of Day (EoD), Anywhere on Earth (AoE), November 24, 2024, and a deadline to vote for the end of day on December 13, 2024.

### Election method

After doing research on various [election software recommended by the FLOSS community](https://github.com/sugarlabs/elections-research), we have decided to use [bettervoting.com](http://bettervoting.com). The software is licensed under the AGPLv3, and the system supports automatic runoff vote tallying. Our internal research on the system can be found in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kuXXL-tVgB1Ptu50cTonWtRnAuKmWn1jyKd1qPgqFJY/edit?tab=t.0).

Again, we encourage you to take the first step and apply for a ballot via our [application form](https://forms.gle/48F6h5wdV6BpSro66), and we look forward to your involvement.

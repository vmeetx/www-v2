## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** Generate more samples using AudioGen and save them in Google Drive.
- **Goal 2:** Experiment with temperature and top_p parameters in AudioGen.

---

## This Week's Achievements

1. **Generated more samples using AudioGen model**  
   - I was able to generate more samples from AudioGen model and saved them in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10UZzts_AuIe1AypJm9v4ll0NQ0tdkHEI?usp=drive_link).

2. **Experimented with different values of temperature and top_p**  
   - I created a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tFjL4bXAyB-Z7Fxj4cqiS4_pRkAGo3gKgs-CZVmkFYk/edit?gid=0#gid=0) where I experimented with generating sound samples using different temperature and top_p values. By recording the results, I was able to determine which parameter settings produce more meaningful sound samples.

## Key Learnings

- I gained an understanding of the key parameters temperature and top_p, which are used to tune the output for specific use cases. This [article](https://medium.com/@1511425435311/understanding-openais-temperature-and-top-p-parameters-in-language-models-d2066504684f) was helpful in understanding these concepts.

---

## Next Week's Roadmap

- To further explore the effects of the temperature and top_p parameters.
- To find an effective method for removing silence and noise from the audio.

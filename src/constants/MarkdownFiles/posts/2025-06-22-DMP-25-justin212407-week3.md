## Goals for This Week

- Design an algorithm for parsing and rendering the brick tree via React components  
- Expose bounding box and connection point data from the model layer  
- Create a prop interface for passing this spatial data into the rendering layer  

---

## This Week’s Highlights

### 1. **Visual Tree Parsing and Rendering Algorithm**

Developed a clean, maintainable algorithm to traverse and render the brick tree structure:
- Each tree node is transformed into a React component, preserving parent-child and neighbor relationships
- Recursive traversal ensures dynamic rendering of nested bricks
- Designed to integrate seamlessly with `BrickTreeManager` and individual brick models

### 2. **Exposed Geometric Metadata in Brick Models**

Implemented structured public getters and setters to handle:
- **Bounding Box (bbox)**: x, y, width, and height of each rendered brick
- **Connection Point Coordinates**: Vary based on brick type (Simple, Expression, Compound)
- Enables precise layout, collision detection, and advanced interaction logic downstream

### 3. **Visual Data Propagation via React Props**

Added a new prop to the core brick rendering components:
- Accepts a callback function
- Receives `bbox` and connection point data as arguments after render
- Supports future enhancements like:
  - Overlay-based debugging
  - Adaptive layout reflows
  - External visualization tools

## Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge: Finding the right parsing algorithm for parsing the tree**   
**Solution:** Implemented stack based traversal with visited node tracking and component key management

**Challenge:  The tree parsing algorithm struggled to correctly identify and maintain parent-child relationships when bricks had multiple connection points or nested expressions**  

**Solution:** Implemented a two-pass algorithm - first pass builds the node structure, second pass establishes parent-child references and validates connection integrity

## Key Learnings

- Algorithm Design

Recursive Patterns: Learned how to structure recursive algorithms for tree traversal that map cleanly to React component hierarchies
Data Structure Mapping: Understanding how to translate tree data structures into renderable React components

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Render the tree upon the storybook given any configuration of bricks.
- List down all the bricks and their configurations.
- Create the pallete UI with all types of bricks present in it.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to my mentors for helping review the algorithm logic for rendering the tree. Their early feedback made the path code significantly more robust and maintainable.

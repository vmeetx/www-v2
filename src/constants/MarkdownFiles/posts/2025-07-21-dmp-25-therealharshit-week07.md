## This Week’s Achievements

1. **Prepared a presentation for the DMP Midterm Evaluation.**  
   - I prepared a comprehensive presentation to showcase the progress of the **Pippy Debugger** at the DMP midterm review. The presentation covered everything from project objectives and methods to current results, challenges, and future plans.
   - Additionaly, I also gave a mock presentation of my work to the Sugar Labs mentors.

2. **Started working on developing API endpoint in Sugar-AI**  
   - Began development of a new `/debug` endpoint in Sugar-AI. This endpoint will handle code input and return structured debug suggestions from the LLM.
   - I have also started the process of integrating Sugar-AI with Pippy.

---

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Understaing Sugar-AI’s existing API structure.  
  **Solution:** I followed the documentaion and my mentors guidance.

---

## Key Learnings

- How to design and deliver a structured presentation.
- Introduction to Sugar-AI’s internal API design and how to extend it.

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Finalize the work of `/debug` endpoint in Sugar-AI.
- Work on making the LLM response more kids friendly.
- Start working on saving debug history to Sugar Journal.

# Week 04 Progress Report by Aman Chadha

**Project:** [JS Internationalization with AI Translation Support](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/pull/4459)  
**Mentors:** [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender), [Devin Ulibarri](https://github.com/devinulibarri)  
**Reporting Period:** 2025-06-24 – 2025-06-30

## Goals for This Week

- Complete RAG-based context generation for **all UI strings** in the `.po` file.
- Translate the Turkish `.po` file using DeepL with generated context.
- Share Turkish translation with mentors for review and validation of context effectiveness.

---

## This Week’s Achievements

1. **Full Context Generation Completed**  
   - Successfully generated context for all 1,536 active `msgid` entries using the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model.
   - Ensured each UI string now has an associated contextual description to guide translators.

2. **Turkish Translation via DeepL with Context**  
   - Used the DeepL API to translate the Turkish `.po` file, injecting the RAG-generated context for each `msgid`.
   - This serves as a real-world test to evaluate how well contextual guidance improves translation accuracy and usability.
   - Currently awaiting feedback on the quality of Turkish translations to assess the effectiveness of the context-driven approach.

## Challenges & How I Addressed Them

- **Challenge:** Integrating RAG-generated context into `.po` translation pipeline.  
  **Solution:** Adapted the `.po` processing script to pair each `msgid` with its context before sending it to DeepL, ensuring translators benefit from semantic clarity.

- **Challenge:** Validating quality of translations in a language I do not speak.  
  **Solution:** Coordinated with mentors to review Turkish output and identify whether contextual enrichment improved translation fidelity.

## Key Learnings

- Contextual guidance significantly strengthens AI-driven translation quality, especially for UI-specific phrases.
- Systematic pairing of context with each string allows scalable improvements across languages.
- Human review remains crucial to validate AI-generated translations and refine context generation methods.

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Collect and analyze mentor feedback on the Turkish `.po` file.
- Fine-tune the RAG context generation logic based on observed shortcomings, if any.
- Generalize the context-injection workflow for use with other languages (e.g., Spanish, French).
- Begin documenting the context generation + translation pipeline for future contributors.

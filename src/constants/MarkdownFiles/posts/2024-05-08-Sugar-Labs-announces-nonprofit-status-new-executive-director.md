**CAMBRIDGE, MA, USA -- May 8, 2024 -- Sugar Labs today announced its 501(c)(3) nonprofit status as well as its pick for executive director, long-time contributor Devin Ulibarri.**

## Sugar Labs is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit

In 2019, the Sugar Labs oversight board voted to incorporate as its own entity and apply for nonprofit status. After that vote, the members of the board began efforts to leave the Software Freedom Conservancy, incorporate as Sugar Labs Inc., and applied for 501(c)(3) nonprofit status. In the spring of 2021, Sugar Labs Inc. was granted nonprofit status from the IRS.

## Devin Ulibarri hired as executive director

In January 2024, the board agreed to hire long-time Sugar Labs contributor Devin Ulibarri as their first full-time executive director. Prior to stepping into this role, he worked as the outreach & communications coordinator for the [Free Software Foundation](https://fsf.org).
